<p>ONEitis is paralysis. You cease to mature, you cease to move, you cease to be you.</p>
<p>"ONEitis"是一种瘫痪状态。你停止成长，停止前进，甚至失去了自我。</p>
<p>There is no ONE. This is the soulmate myth. There are some good Ones and some bad Ones, but there is no ONE. Anyone telling you anything else is selling you something. There are LOTS of ‘special someones’ out there for you, just ask the divorced/widowed person who’s remarried after their “soulmate” has died or moved on.</p>
<p>不存在所谓的“唯一”。这是灵魂伴侣的迷思。有些人很好，有些人则不然，但并不存在那个“唯一”。任何告诉你其他说法的人都是在向你兜售某种东西。实际上，有许多“特别的人”在等着你，只需问问那些在“灵魂伴侣”去世或离开后再次结婚的离异或丧偶者便知。</p>
<p>This is what trips people up about the soul-mate myth, it is this fantasy that we all at least in some way share an idealization of – that there is ONE perfect mate for each of us, and as soon as the planets align and fate takes it’s course we’ll know that we’re ‘intended’ for each other. And while this may make for a gratifying romantic comedy plot, it’s hardly a realistic way to plan your life. In fact it’s usually paralyzing.</p>
<p>这就是人们被灵魂伴侣神话绊倒的原因，我们或多或少都共享着这样一个理想化的幻想——即每个人都有一个完美的伴侣，一旦星辰排列、命运展开，我们就会知道彼此是“命中注定”的。尽管这可能构成一部令人满意的浪漫喜剧情节，但它绝不是规划生活的现实方式。事实上，它通常会让人陷入瘫痪。</p>
<p>What I find even more fascinating is how common the idea is (mostly for guys) that a nuts &amp; bolts view of life should be trumped by this fantasy in the area of inter-sexual relationships. Guys who would otherwise recognize the value of understanding psychology, biology, sociology, evolution, business, engineering, etc. and the interplay we see these take place in our lives on a daily basis, are some of the first guys to become violently opposed to the idea that maybe there isn’t ‘someone for everyone’ or that there are a lot more ONEs out there that could meet or exceed the criteria we subconsciously set for them to be the ONE. I think it comes off as nihilistic or this dread that maybe their ego investment in this belief is false- it’s like saying God is dead to the deeply religious. It’s just too terrible to contemplate that there maybe no ONE or there maybe several ONEs to spend their lives with. This western romanticized mythology is based on the premise that there is only ONE perfect mate for any single individual and as much as a lifetime can and should be spent in constant search of this ‘soulmate.’ So strong and so pervasive is this myth in our collective society that it has become akin to a religious statement and in fact has been integrated into many religious doctrines as feminization of western culture has spread.</p>
<p>我发现更令人着迷的是，这种观念在异性关系领域内如何普遍（主要针对男性），即认为对生活的务实看法应被这种幻想所取代。那些通常能认识到心理学、生物学、社会学、进化论、商业、工程学等学科价值及其在日常生活中相互作用的男性，却往往是最先强烈反对“并非每个人都有一个命中注定的人”或“可能存在许多符合或超越我们潜意识设定的‘唯一’标准的人”这一观点的人。我认为这显得有些虚无主义，或是对这种信念中自我投入可能为假的恐惧——就像对虔诚的宗教信徒说“上帝已死”一样。一想到可能没有“唯一”，或者可能有多个“唯一”来共度一生，就让人难以接受。这种西方浪漫化的神话基于一个前提：对每个个体而言，存在一个完美的伴侣，并且一生都应该不断寻找这个“灵魂伴侣”。这个神话在我们集体社会中如此强大且无处不在，以至于它几乎等同于一种宗教宣言，并且随着西方文化女性化的传播，它实际上已被融入到许多宗教教义中。</p>
<p>I think there’s been a mischaracterization of ONEitis. It’s necessary to differentiate between a healthy relationship based on mutual respect and a lopsided ONEitis based relationship. I’ve had more than a few guys seeking my advice, or challenging my take on ONEitis, essentially ask me for permission to accept ONEitis as legitimate monogamy. In my estimation ONEitis is an unhealthy psychological dependency that is the direct result of the continuous socialization of the soulmate myth in pop culture. What’s truly frightening is that ONEitis has become associated with being a healthy normative aspect of an LTR or marriage.</p>
<p>我认为对“唯一症”（ONEitis）的描述存在误解。有必要区分基于相互尊重的健康关系与基于失衡“唯一症”的关系。不少男士曾寻求我的建议，或质疑我对“唯一症”的看法，实质上是希望我认可“唯一症”作为合法一夫一妻制的存在。在我看来，“唯一症”是一种不健康的心理依赖，直接源于流行文化中对“灵魂伴侣”神话的持续社会化。真正令人担忧的是，“唯一症”已被视为长期关系或婚姻中健康且正常的组成部分。</p>
<p>I come to the conclusion that ONEitis is based in sociological roots, not only due to it being a statement of personal belief, but by the degree to which this ideology is disseminated and mass marketed in popular culture through media, music, literature, movies, etc. Dating services like eHarmony shamelessly marketeer and exploit exactly the insecurities that this dynamic engenders in people desperately searching for the ONE “they were intended for.” The idea that men possess a natural capacity for protection, provisioning and monogamy has merit from both a social and bio-psychological standpoint, but a ONEitis psychosis is not a byproduct of it. Rather, I would set it apart from this healthy protector/provider dynamic since ONEitis essentially sabotages what our natural propensities would otherwise filter.</p>
<p>我得出结论，ONEitis 植根于社会学根源，不仅因为它是一种个人信仰的陈述，还因为它在流行文化中通过媒体、音乐、文学、电影等途径传播和大规模营销的程度。像 eHarmony 这样的约会服务无耻地营销并利用了这种动态在人们迫切寻找“命中注定的那个人”时产生的不安全感。从社会和生物心理学的角度来看，男性拥有保护、供养和一夫一妻制的自然能力这一观点是有道理的，但 ONEitis 心理疾病并非由此产生。相反，我会将其与这种健康的保护者/供养者动态区分开来，因为 ONEitis 本质上破坏了我们自然倾向原本会筛选的东西。</p>
<p>ONEitis is insecurity run amok while a person is single, and potentially paralyzing when coupled with the object of that ONEitis in an LTR. The same neurotic desperation that drives a person to settle for their ONE whether healthy or unhealthy is the same insecurity that paralyzes them from abandoning a damaging relationship – This is their ONE and how could they ever live without them? Or, they’re my ONE, but all I need is to fix myself or fix them to have my idealized relationship. And this idealization of a relationship is at the root of ONEitis. With such a limiting, all-or-nothing binary approach to searching for ONE needle in the haystack, and investing emotional effort over the course of a lifetime, how do we mature into a healthy understanding of what that relationship should really entail? The very pollyanna, idealized relationship – the “happily ever after” – that belief in a ONE promotes as an ultimate end, is thwarted and contradicted by the costs of the constant pursuit of the ONE for which they’ll settle for. After the better part of a lifetime is invested in this ideology, how much more difficult will it be to come to the realization that the person they’re with isn’t their ONE? To what extents will a person go to in order to protect a lifetime of this ego investment?</p>
<p>"ONEitis"是一种单身时期极度不安全感的表现，当与所迷恋的对象进入长期关系时，这种不安全感可能会变得瘫痪性。正是这种神经质的迫切感，驱使一个人无论健康与否都愿意接受他们的"唯一"，也是同样的不安全感，使他们无法摆脱一段有害的关系——这是他们的"唯一"，他们怎能离开他们而活？或者，他们是我的"唯一"，但我只需要修复自己或修复他们，就能拥有理想中的关系。这种对关系的理想化是"ONEitis"的根源。以这种限制性的、非此即彼的二元方式去寻找那根海中针，并在一生中投入情感努力，我们如何才能成熟地理解这种关系真正应该包含的内容呢？正是这种过于乐观、理想化的关系——"从此幸福快乐"——"ONEitis"所推崇的终极目标，被不断追求"唯一"的代价所阻碍和矛盾。 在将大半生投入这种理念之后，意识到身边的人并非自己的唯一，该有多么困难？为了捍卫这一生对自我价值的投入，一个人会做到何种程度？</p>
<p>At some point in a ONEitis relationship one participant will establish dominance based on the powerlessness that this ONEitis necessitates. There is no greater agency for a woman than to know beyond doubt that she is the only source of a man’s need for sex and intimacy. ONEitis only cements this into the understanding of both parties. For a man who believes that the emotionally and psychologically damaging relationship he has ego-invested himself  is with the only person in his lifetime he’s ever going to be compatible with, there is nothing more paralyzing in his maturation. The same of course holds true for women, and this is why we shake our heads when the beautiful HB 9 goes chasing back to her abusive and indifferent Jerk boyfriend, because she believes he is her ONE and the only source of security available to her. Hypergamy may be her root imperative for sticking with him, but it’s the soul-mate myth, the fear of the “ONE that got away” that makes for the emotional investment.</p>
<p>在一段“唯一情结”关系中的某个时刻，一方会基于这种“唯一情结”所必需的无能为力建立起支配地位。对女性而言，没有什么比确信自己是男性性需求和亲密感的唯一来源更能赋予她权力了。这种“唯一情结”只会加深双方对此的理解。对于一个自认为与生命中唯一能与之相匹配的人陷入情感和心理上极具破坏性的关系的男性来说，没有什么比这更阻碍他的成熟了。当然，女性亦是如此，这也是为何当我们看到那位美丽的 9 分女不顾一切回到她那虐待且冷漠的“坏男孩”男友身边时，我们会摇头叹息，因为她相信他是她的“唯一”，是她唯一的安全来源。虽然出于择偶策略的本能她可能坚持与他在一起，但正是这种“灵魂伴侣”的神话，以及对“错过的唯一”的恐惧，构成了她的情感投入。</p>
<p>The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives. Subscribing to the soulmate mythology necessitates that we recognize powerlessness in this arena of our lives. Better I think it would be to foster a healthy understanding that there is no ONE. There are some good Ones and there are some bad Ones, but there is no ONE.</p>
<p>权力的定义并非财务上的成功、地位或对他人的影响力，而是我们对自己生活掌控的程度。信奉灵魂伴侣的神话，意味着我们必须承认在这一生活领域中的无力感。我认为，培养一种健康的认识会更好，即不存在唯一的完美伴侣。有些是好的，有些则不然，但并不存在那个唯一的完美伴侣。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-cardinal-rule-of-relationships"><a class="header" href="#the-cardinal-rule-of-relationships">The Cardinal Rule of Relationships</a></h1>
<p>关系中的基本原则</p>
<p><em><strong>In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.</strong></em>
在任何关系中，拥有最大权力的人往往是那个最不需要对方的人。</p>
<p>This is a foundation of any relationship, not just intersexual ones, but family, business, etc. relationships as well. It is a dynamic that is always in effect. For my own well being and that of my family’s, I need my employer more than he needs me, ergo I get up for work in the morning and work for him. And while I am also a vital part for the uninterrupted continuance of his company and endeavours, he simply needs me less than I need him. Now I could win the lottery tomorrow or he may decide to cut my pay or limit my benefits, or I may complete my Masters Degree and decide that I can do better than to keep myself yoked to his cart indefinitely, thereby, through some condition either initiated by myself or not, I am put into a position of needing him less than he needs me. At this point he is forced into a position of deciding how much I am worth to his ambitions and either part ways with me or negotiate a furtherance of our relationship.</p>
<p>这是任何关系的基础，不仅限于异性关系，还包括家庭、商业等关系。这种动态始终在起作用。为了我自己和家人的福祉，我需要我的雇主多于他需要我，因此我早晨起床去工作，为他效力。尽管我对于他公司和事业的持续运作至关重要，但他对我的依赖程度不及我对他的需求。现在，我可能明天赢得彩票，或者他可能决定削减我的薪酬或限制我的福利，又或者我完成硕士学位后决定，我值得更好的，不愿永远被束缚在他的马车上。因此，通过某种由我发起或非我发起的条件，我处于一个不再那么需要他的位置。此时，他被迫决定我在他抱负中的价值，并选择与我分道扬镳或协商进一步发展我们的关系。</p>
<p>The same plays true for intersexual relationships. Whether you want to base your relationship on ‘power’ or not isn’t the issue; it’s already in play from your first point of attraction. You are acceptable to her for meeting any number of criteria and she meets your own as well. If this weren’t the case you simply would not initiate a mutual relationship. This is the first comparisson we make with another individual – call it ‘sizing up’ if you like – but we make innate (and often unconscious) comparisons about everything and in the case of initial attraction we decide if the the other person is acceptable for our own intimacy. From this point it becomes a cooperative negotiation.</p>
<p>异性关系亦是如此。你是否想以“权力”为基础来建立关系并非关键；从你最初的吸引力开始，它就已经在发挥作用了。你符合她的某些标准，而她也符合你的标准。如果不是这样，你们根本不会开始一段相互的关系。这是我们与另一个人进行的第一种比较——如果你愿意，可以称之为“评估”——但我们对所有事物都进行着内在的（且常常是无意识的）比较，在最初的吸引中，我们决定对方是否适合我们的亲密关系。从这一点开始，它就变成了一种合作的协商过程。</p>
<p>This principle isn’t so much about ‘power’ as it is about control. This might sound like semantics, but it does make a difference. It’s very easy to slip into binary arguments and think that what I mean by the cardinal rule of relationships is that one participant must absolutely rule over the other – a domineering dominant personality to a doormat submissive personality. Control in a healthy relationship passes back and forth as desire and need dictate for each partner. In an unhealthy realationship you have an unbalanced manipulation of this control by a partner.</p>
<p>这一原则与其说是关于“权力”，不如说是关于控制。这听起来可能像是语义上的区别，但确实有所不同。人们很容易陷入二元论的争论中，认为我所指的关系中的基本规则是，一方必须绝对统治另一方——一个支配性的主导性格对一个逆来顺受的顺从性格。在健康的关系中，控制权根据双方的需求和愿望来回转移。而在不健康的关系中，一方会通过不平衡的操纵来掌控这种控制权。</p>
<p>Although control is never in complete balance, it becomes manipulation when one partner, in essence, blackmails the other with what would otherwise be a behavioral reinforcer for the manipulated partner under healthy circumstances. This happens for a variety of different reasons, but the condition comes about by two ways – the submissive participant becomes conditioned to allow the manipulation to occur and/or the dominant one initiates the manipulation. In either case the rule still holds true – the one who needs the other the least has the most control. Nowhere is this more evident than in interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>尽管控制从未达到完全平衡，但当一方实质上以在健康情况下本应是受控方行为强化因素的事物来胁迫另一方时，这就变成了操纵。这种情况的出现有多种不同原因，但其形成条件有两种途径——顺从的一方变得习惯于允许操纵发生，和/或支配的一方发起操纵。无论哪种情况，规则依然成立——最不依赖对方的一方拥有最大的控制权。这一点在人际关系中表现得尤为明显。</p>
<p>Too many people who I counsel and read my posts (here and elsewhere) assume that this Rule means that I’m advocating the maintaining a position of dominance at the expense of their partners; far from it. I do however advocate that people – young men in particular – develop a better sense of self-worth and a better understanding of their true efficacy in their relationships (assuming you decide to become involved in one). Don’t get me wrong, both sexes are guilty of manipulation; Battered women go back to their abusive boyfriends/husbands and pussy whipped men compromise themselves and their ambitions to better serve their girlfriend’s insecurities. My intent in promoting this Rule is to open the eyes of young men who are already predisposed to devaluing themselves and placing women as the goal of their lives rather than seeing themselves as the PRIZE to be sought after. Compromise is always going to be a part of any relationship, but what’s key is realizing when that compromise becomes the result of manipulation, what is in effect, then developing the confidence to be uncompromising in those situations. This is where a firm understanding of the cardinal rule of relationships becomes essential.</p>
<p>太多向我咨询并阅读我文章（无论在此处还是其他地方）的人误以为这条规则意味着我主张以牺牲伴侣为代价维持主导地位；远非如此。然而，我的确提倡人们——尤其是年轻男性——培养更强的自我价值感，并更深入地理解自己在关系中的真实效能（假设你决定投身其中）。请别误会，两性都存在操控行为；遭受虐待的女性会回到施暴的男友或丈夫身边，而受制于女友的男性则牺牲自我和抱负，只为更好地迎合她们的不安全感。我推广这条规则的初衷，是唤醒那些本就倾向于自我贬低、将女性视为生活目标而非将自己视作追求奖赏的年轻男性。妥协在任何关系中都不可避免，但关键在于认清何时妥协源于操控，进而培养在那种情境下坚定不移的自信。 这是对关系基本原则的深刻理解变得至关重要的地方。</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with backing down from an argument you have with your girlfriend, but there is something wrong when you continually compromise yourself in order to ‘keep the peace’ with the understanding that she’ll withhold intimacy as a result of you holding your ground. That is a power play, also known as a ‘shit test’. She initiates it thus becoming the controlling party.
与女友争论时退让并无不妥，但若你为了“维持和平”而不断妥协自己，心知肚明她会因你坚守立场而拒绝亲密，那便有问题了。这是一种权力游戏，俗称“试探底线”。她发起这一行为，从而成为掌控方。</p>
<p>No woman’s intimacy (i.e. sex) is ever worth that compromise because in doing so you devalue your own worth to her. Once this precident is set, she will progressively have less respect for you – exactly opposite of the popular conception that she’ll appreciate your compromising for her and reward you for your “sensitivity”.</p>
<p>没有任何女性的亲密（即性）值得你做出这样的妥协，因为这样做会贬低你自身的价值。一旦这种先例形成，她对你的尊重将逐渐减少——这与流行的观念完全相反，即她会感激你的妥协，并因你的“敏感”而回报你。</p>
<p>And really, what are you compromising in order to achieve? Set in this condition, her intimacy. That isn’t genuine desire or real interest in you, it’s a subtle psychological test (that all too many men are unaware of) meant to determine who needs the other more. There is no more a superior confidence for a man than one with the self-understanding that he will not compromise himself for the recognized manipulations of a woman, and the fortitude to walk away knowing he can and will find a better prospect than her. This is the man who passes the shit test. It’s called ‘enlightened self-interest’ -— I cannot help others until I can help myself — and a principle I wholely endorse.</p>
<p>实际上，为了达成目的，你在妥协什么？在这种条件下，她的亲近。那并非真正的欲望或对你真实的兴趣，而是一种微妙的心理测试（太多男性未曾察觉），旨在判断谁更需要对方。对一个男人来说，没有什么比自我认知更自信的了，他明白自己不会为了一个女人已知的操控而妥协，且有勇气离开，深知自己能找到比她更好的选择。这就是通过“狗屎测试”的男人。这被称为“开明的自我利益”——在我能帮助他人之前，我必须先帮助自己——这一原则我完全赞同。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-desire-dynamic"><a class="header" href="#the-desire-dynamic">The Desire Dynamic</a></h1>
<p><strong>You cannot negotiate Desire.
你无法谈判欲望。</strong></p>
<p>This is a very simple principle that most Men and the vast majority of women are willfully ignorant of. One the most common personal problems I’ve been asked advice for in the past 10 years is some variation of “how do I get her back?” Usually this breaks down into men seeking some methodology to return his relationship to an earlier state where a previously passionate woman couldn’t keep her hands off of him. Six months into a comfortable familiarity and the thrill is gone, but in truth it’s the genuine desire that is gone.</p>
<p>这是一个非常简单的原则，大多数男性以及绝大多数女性都故意忽视它。过去 10 年间，我被咨询最多的个人问题之一就是各种形式的“我如何才能让她回心转意？”通常，这涉及到男性寻求某种方法，希望将他们的关系恢复到之前的状态，那时一个曾经热情似火的女人对他爱不释手。然而，六个月舒适熟悉之后，激情已逝，实际上，是那份真挚的渴望已不复存在。</p>
<p>It’s often at this stage that a man will resort to negotiation. Sometimes this can be as subtle as him progressively doing things for her in the hopes that she’ll reciprocate with the same sexual fervor they used to have. Other times a married couple may go to marriage counseling to “resolve their sex issues” and negotiate terms for her sexual compliance. He’ll promise to do the dishes and a load of laundry more often in exchange for her feigned sexual interest in him. Yet, no matter what terms are offered, no matter how great an external effort he makes so deserving of reward, the genuine desire is not there for her. In fact, she feels worse for not having the desire after such efforts were made for her compliance.</p>
<p>在这个阶段，男人往往会诉诸谈判。有时，这可能微妙到他逐渐为她做些事情，希望她能以曾经同样的热情回应他的性需求。其他时候，一对已婚夫妇可能会寻求婚姻咨询，以“解决他们的性问题”，并就她的性服从进行谈判。他会承诺更频繁地洗碗和洗衣服，以换取她对他假装出的性兴趣。然而，无论提出什么条件，无论他为了得到回报而付出多么巨大的外在努力，她内心真正的欲望却并不存在。事实上，她在努力达成她的服从后，因为没有欲望而感到更加糟糕。</p>
<p><strong>Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance.
协商的欲望只会导致被迫的顺从。</strong></p>
<p>This is why her post-negotiation sexual response is often so lackluster and the source of even further frustration on his part. She may be more sexually available to him, but the half-hearted experience is never the same as when they first met when there was no negotiation, just spontaneous desire for each other.</p>
<p>这就是为什么她在谈判后的性反应往往如此乏味，甚至成为他进一步沮丧的源头。她可能对他更加性开放，但这种半心半意的体验永远无法与他们初次相遇时相提并论，那时无需谈判，只有彼此间自发的渴望。</p>
<p>From a male perspective, and particularly that of an uninitiated beta male, negotiation of desire seems a rational solution to the problem. Men tend to innately rely on deductive reasoning; otherwise known as an “if then” logic stream. The code is often something like this:</p>
<p>从男性视角，尤其是未入门的贝塔男性的角度来看，协商欲望似乎是解决问题的理性方案。男性往往天生依赖演绎推理；也就是所谓的“如果那么”逻辑流。这种逻辑常常是这样的：</p>
<p>I need sex + women have the sex I want + query women about their conditions for sex + meet prerequisites for sex = the sex I want.
我需要性 + 女性拥有我想要的性 + 询问女性关于性的条件 + 满足性的先决条件 = 我想要的性。</p>
<p>Makes sense right? It’s simple economics, but built on a foundation that relies on a woman’s accurate self-evaluations. The genuine desire they used to experience at the outset of their relationship was predicated upon a completely unknown set of variables. Overtly communicating a desire for reciprocal desire creates obligation, and sometimes even ultimatums. Genuine desire is something a person must come to – or be led to – on their own volition. You can force a woman by threat to comply with behaving in a desired manner, but you cannot make her want to behave that way. A prostitute will fuck you for an exchange, it doesn’t mean she wants to.</p>
<p>有道理吧？这是简单的经济学原理，但建立在女性准确自我评估的基础上。她们在关系初期所经历的真诚渴望，是基于一系列完全未知的变量。公开表达对互惠渴望的需求会带来义务，有时甚至是最后通牒。真正的渴望是个人必须自发达到或被引导达到的。你可以通过威胁迫使女性以期望的方式行事，但你无法让她真心想要那样做。一个妓女会为了交换而与你发生关系，这并不意味着她愿意。</p>
<p>Whether LTR or a one night stand (ONS) strive for genuine desire in your relationships. Half of the battle is knowing you want to be with a woman who wants to please you, not one who feels obligated to. You will never draw this genuine desire from her by overt means, but you can covertly lead her to this genuine desire. The trick in provoking real desire is in keeping her ignorant of your intent to provoke it. Real desire is created by her thinking it’s something she wants, not something she has to do.</p>
<p>无论是长期关系（LTR）还是一夜情（ONS），都应追求关系中的真诚欲望。战斗的一半在于明白你想要的是一个愿意取悦你的女人，而非感到有义务如此的女人。你无法通过直接手段从她那里唤起这种真诚欲望，但你可以间接引导她达到这种真诚欲望。激发真正欲望的诀窍在于让她对你的意图一无所知。真正的欲望是由她认为这是她想要的东西，而非她必须做的事情所创造的。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="schedules-of-mating"><a class="header" href="#schedules-of-mating">Schedules of Mating</a></h1>
<p>There are methods and social contrivances women have used for centuries to ensure that the best male’s genes are selected and secured with the best male provisioning she’s capable of attracting. Ideally the best Man should exemplify both, <strong>but rarely do the two exist in the same male</strong> (particularly these days) so in the interest of achieving her biological imperative, and prompted by an innate need for security, the feminine as a whole had to develop social conventions and methodologies (which change as her environment and personal conditions do) to effect this. Men are not only up against a female genetic imperative, but also centuries long feminine social conventions established and adapted from a time long before human beings could accurately determine genetic origins.</p>
<p>几个世纪以来，女性运用各种方法和社会手段，以确保选择并确保最佳男性的基因，并吸引到她所能吸引到的最佳男性的供养。理想情况下，最佳男性应兼具这两者，但这两者很少同时存在于同一个男性身上（尤其是在当今时代）。因此，为了实现其生物学上的使命，并在内在安全需求的驱使下，女性作为一个整体，不得不发展出社会习俗和方法论（这些会随着她的环境和个体条件的变化而变化），以实现这一目标。男性不仅面临着女性的遗传使命，还面临着由来已久的女性社会习俗，这些习俗建立并适应于人类能够准确确定遗传起源之前的漫长时期。</p>
<p>I’ve detailed in many prior threads that mate selection is a psycho-biological function that millennia of evolution has hardwired into both sexes. So internalized and socialized is this process into our collective psyches that we rarely recognize we’re subject to these motivators even when we continually repeat the same behaviors manifested by them (such as having the second kid with the Alpha Bad Boy). So saying that we’re not subject to conditions we’re or are only vaguely aware of is a bit naive.
我在许多先前的讨论中详细阐述了，择偶是一种心理生物学功能，经过数千年的进化，已被深深植入两性之中。这一过程如此内化和社会化地融入我们的集体心理，以至于我们很少意识到自己受到这些动机的驱使，即使我们不断重复由它们表现出的相同行为（例如与阿尔法坏男孩生第二个孩子）。因此，声称我们不受那些我们或仅模糊意识到的条件的制约，未免有些天真。</p>
<p>It’s simple deductive logic to follow that for a species to survive it must provide its offspring with the best possible conditions to ensure its survival – either that or to reproduce in such quantity that it ensures survival. The obvious application of this for women is sharing parental investment with the best possible mate her own genetics allow her to attract and who can provide long term security for her and any potential offspring. Thus women are biologically, psychologically and sociologically the filters of their own reproduction, where as men’s reproductive methodology is to scatter as much of his genetic material as humanly possible to the widest available quantity of sexually available females. He of course has his own criteria for mating selection and determining the best genetic pairing for his reproduction (i.e. she’s gotta be hot), but his criteria is certainly less discriminating than that for women (i.e. no one’s ugly after 2am). This is evidenced in our own hormonal biology; men possess between 12 and17 times the amount of testosterone (the primary hormone in sexual arousal) women do and women produce substantially more estrogen (instrumental in sexual caution) and oxytocin (fostering feelings of security and nurturing) than men.</p>
<p>遵循简单的演绎逻辑，一个物种要生存下去，必须为其后代提供最佳的生存条件，或者通过大量繁殖来确保生存。对女性而言，这一逻辑的直接应用是与最优质的伴侣共同承担育儿责任，这个伴侣应是她凭借自身基因能够吸引到的，并能为其及任何潜在后代提供长期保障的人。因此，女性在生物学、心理学和社会学层面上，都是自身繁殖的筛选者，而男性的繁殖策略则是尽可能广泛地将其遗传物质散布给尽可能多的可交配女性。当然，男性在选择交配对象和确定最佳遗传组合时也有自己的标准（比如她必须有吸引力），但相比女性，他们的标准显然不那么严格（比如凌晨两点后没人是丑的）。 这一点在我们的荷尔蒙生物学中得到了体现；男性体内的睾酮（性兴奋的主要激素）含量是女性的 12 至 17 倍，而女性产生的雌激素（与性警觉相关）和催产素（促进安全感和养育感）则远多于男性。</p>
<p>That stated, both of these methodologies conflict in practice. For a woman to best ensure the survival of her young, a man must necessarily abandon his method of reproduction in favor of her own. This then sets a contradictory imperative for him to pair with a woman who will satisfy his methodology. A male must sacrifice his reproductive schedule to satisfy that of the woman he pairs with. Thus, with so much genetic potential at stake on his part of the risk, he want’s not only to ensure that she is the best possible candidate for breeding (and future breeding), but also to know that his progeny will benefit from both parent’s investment.</p>
<p>话虽如此，这两种方法论在实践中存在冲突。为了最大限度地确保幼崽的生存，男性必须放弃自己的繁殖方式，转而采用女性的方式。这进而为他设定了一个矛盾的指令，即要与一个能满足其繁殖方法的女性配对。男性必须牺牲自己的繁殖计划以适应与之配对的女性的计划。因此，由于他的风险承担部分涉及大量遗传潜力，他不仅希望确保她是最佳的繁殖（及未来繁殖）候选人，还希望知道他的后代能从双方的投资中获益。</p>
<p>Side note: One interesting outcome of this psycho-biological dynamic is men’s ability to spot their own children in a crowd of other children more quickly and with greater acuity than even their mothers. Studies have shown that men have the ability to more quickly and accurately identify their own children in a room full of kids dressed in the same uniforms than the mothers of the child. Again, this stresses the subconscious importance of this genetic trade off.</p>
<p>附注：这一心理生物学动态的一个有趣结果是，男性在众多儿童中识别自己孩子的速度和准确度，甚至超过母亲。研究表明，男性能在满屋穿着相同制服的孩子中，比孩子的母亲更快更准确地辨认出自己的孩子。这再次强调了这种基因交换在潜意识中的重要性。</p>
<p>These are the rudiments of human sexual selection and reproduction. There are many other social, emotional, psychological intricacies that are associated with these fundamentals, but they are the underlying motivations and considerations that subconsciously influence sexual selection.</p>
<p>这些是人类性选择和繁殖的基础。还有许多其他与这些基本原则相关的社会、情感和心理复杂性，但它们是潜意识中影响性选择的根本动机和考虑因素。</p>
<h2 id="social-convention-社会习俗"><a class="header" href="#social-convention-社会习俗">Social Convention 社会习俗</a></h2>
<p>To counter this subconscious dynamic to their own genetic advantage women initiate social conventions and psychological schemas to better facilitate their own breeding methodologies. This is why women always have the “prerogative to change her mind” and the most fickle of behaviors become socially excusable, while men’s behavior is constrained to a higher standard of responsibility to “do the right thing” which is invariably to the advantage of a woman’s reproductive scheme . This is why guys who are ‘Players’, and fathers who abandon mothers to pursue their innate reproduction method are villains, and fathers who selflessly sacrifice themselves financially, emotionally and life decision-wise, often to the benefit of children they didn’t father, are considered social heroes for complying with women’s genetic imperatives.</p>
<p>为了对抗这种潜意识中对自身基因有利的动态，女性会发起社会习俗和心理模式，以更好地促进自身的繁衍策略。这就是为什么女性总是拥有“改变主意的特权”，最反复无常的行为也变得社会可接受，而男性的行为则被约束在更高的责任感标准上，即“做正确的事”，而这往往符合女性的生殖计划。这就是为什么那些“花花公子”和抛弃母亲去追求其固有繁衍方式的父亲被视为恶人，而那些无私地从经济、情感乃至生活决策上牺牲自己，常常惠及非亲生子女的父亲，则因顺应女性的基因需求而被视为社会英雄。</p>
<p>This is also the root motivation for female-specific social dynamics such as LJBF rejections, women’s propensity for victimhood (as they’ve learned that this engenders ‘savior’ mental schemas for men’s breeding schedules – Cap’n Save a Ho) and even marriage itself.</p>
<p>这也是女性特有的社会动态的根源，如“朋友区”拒绝、女性倾向于扮演受害者角色（因为她们已了解到这会激发男性“拯救者”心理模式，以适应其繁衍计划——“船长救美”），乃至婚姻本身。</p>
<h2 id="good-dads-vs-good-genes-好爸爸与好基因"><a class="header" href="#good-dads-vs-good-genes-好爸爸与好基因">Good Dads vs Good Genes 好爸爸与好基因</a></h2>
<p>The two greatest difficulties for women to overcome in their own methodology is that they are only at a sexually viable peak for a short window of time (generally their 20s) and the fact that the qualities that make a good long term partner (the Good Dad) and the qualities that make for good breeding stock (Good Genes) only rarely manifest themselves in the same male. Provisioning and security potential are fantastic motivators for pairing with a Good Dad, but the same characteristics that make him such are generally a disadvantage when compared with the man who better exemplifies genetic, physical attraction and the risk taking qualities that would imbue her child with a better capacity to adapt to its environment (i.e stronger, faster, more attractive than others to ensure the passing of her own genetic material to future generations). This is the Jerk vs. Nice Guy paradox writ large on an evolutionary scale.
女性在自身方法论中需克服的两大难题是，她们在性方面具有生育能力的巅峰期非常短暂（通常在 20 多岁），以及那些构成长期理想伴侣（好父亲）的特质与那些利于优良后代繁衍（优质基因）的特质，极少在同一男性身上同时体现。与一个好父亲结合，其提供的物质保障和安全潜力是强大的驱动力，但这些特质在遗传、身体吸引力及冒险精神方面，通常不及那些更能赋予孩子适应环境优势（即更强壮、更快速、更具吸引力，以确保自身基因能传递至后代）的男性。这便是进化尺度上的“混蛋与好人”悖论。</p>
<p>Men and women innately (though unconsciously) understand this dynamic, so in order for a woman to have the best that the Good Dad has to offer while taking advantage of the best that the Good Genes man has, she must invent and constantly modify social conventions to keep the advantage in her biological favor.</p>
<p>男女双方天生（尽管是无意识地）理解这一动态，因此，为了让女性既能获得好父亲所能提供的最佳条件，又能利用好基因男性的优势，她必须创造并不断修改社会习俗，以保持其生物学上的优势。</p>
<h2 id="reproductive-schedules-生殖时间表"><a class="header" href="#reproductive-schedules-生殖时间表">Reproductive Schedules 生殖时间表</a></h2>
<p>This paradox then necessitates that women (and by default men) must subscribe to short term and long term schedules of mating. Short term schedules facilitate breeding with the Good Genes male, while long term breeding is reserved the Good Dad male. This convention and the psycho-social schemas that accompany it are precisely why women will marry the Nice Guy, stable, loyal, (preferably) doctor and still fuck the pool boy or the cute surfer she met on spring break. In our genetic past, a male with good genes implied an ability to be a good provider, but modern convention has thwarted this, so new social and mental schemas had to be developed for women.
这一悖论进而要求女性（以及默认的男性）必须遵循短期和长期的交配时间表。短期时间表便于与拥有优质基因的男性繁殖，而长期繁殖则留给成为好父亲的男性。这种惯例及其伴随的心理社会模式正是为何女性会嫁给那位善良、稳定、忠诚（最好是）医生的原因，同时仍会与泳池管理员或春假期间遇到的迷人冲浪者发生关系。在我们基因的过去，拥有优质基因的男性意味着有能力成为好的供养者，但现代习俗已颠覆了这一点，因此女性需要发展新的社会和心理模式。</p>
<h2 id="cheating-作弊"><a class="header" href="#cheating-作弊">Cheating 作弊</a></h2>
<p>For this dynamic and the practicality of enjoying the best of both genetic worlds, women find it necessary to ‘cheat’. This cheating can be done proactively or reactively.
为了这种动态以及享受两种基因世界最佳之处的实用性，女性发现有必要“作弊”。这种作弊可以是主动进行的，也可以是被动应对的。</p>
<p>In the reactive model, a woman who has already paired with her long term partner choice, engages in a extramarital or extra-pairing, sexual intercourse with a short term partner (i.e. the cheating wife or girlfriend). That’s not to say this short term opportunity cannot develop into a 2nd, long term mate, but the action of infidelity itself is a method for securing better genetic stock than the committed male provider is capable of supplying.
在反应模型中，一位已与长期伴侣配对的女性，会与短期伴侣（即出轨的妻子或女友）发生婚外或婚外配对性行为。这并不是说这种短期机会不能发展成第二个长期伴侣，但出轨行为本身是一种确保获得比忠诚男性提供者所能提供的更优质基因的手段。</p>
<p>Proactive cheating is the single Mommy dilema. This form of ‘cheating’ relies on the woman breeding with a Good Genes male, bearing his children and then abandoning him, or having him abandon her, (again through invented social conventions) in order to find a Good Dad male to provide for her and the children of her Good Genes partner to ensure their security.
主动欺骗是单亲妈妈面临的独特困境。这种“欺骗”行为依赖于女性与拥有优质基因的男性生育，产下他的孩子后，或被他抛弃，或通过虚构的社会习俗主动离开他，以便寻找一个好父亲型的男性来供养她和前一位优质基因伴侣的孩子，确保他们的生活稳定。</p>
<p>I want to stress again that (most) women do not have some consciously constructed and recognized master plan to enact this cycle and deliberately trap men into it. Rather, the motivations for this behavior and the accompanying social rationales invented to justify it are an unconscious process. For the most part, women are unaware of this dynamic, but are nonetheless subject to its influence. For a female of any species to facilitate a methodology for breeding with the best genetic partner she’s able to attract AND to ensure her own and her offspring’s survival with the best provisioning partner; this is an evolutionary jackpot.</p>
<p>我想再次强调，（大多数）女性并没有一个刻意构建并被认可的主计划来实施这一循环，并故意将其中的男性困住。相反，这种行为的动机以及随之而来的、用以证明其合理性的社会理由，是一个无意识的过程。在很大程度上，女性并不了解这一动态，但仍然受到其影响。对于任何物种的女性来说，能够促成一种与她能吸引到的最佳基因伴侣繁殖的方法，并确保自己和后代与最佳供养伴侣一起生存；这无疑是进化的巨大胜利。</p>
<h2 id="the-cuckold-绿帽丈夫"><a class="header" href="#the-cuckold-绿帽丈夫">The Cuckold 《绿帽丈夫》</a></h2>
<p>On some level of consciousness, men innately sense something is wrong with this situation, though they may not be able to place why they feel it or misunderstand it in the confusion of women’s justifications for it. Or they become frustrated by the social pressures to ‘do the right thing’, are shamed into martyrdom/savior-hood and committed to a feigned responsibility to these conventions. Nevertheless, some see it well enough to steer clear of single mothers, either by prior experience or observing other male cuckolds saddled with the responsibility of raising and providing for – no matter how involved or uninvolved – another man’s successful reproduction efforts with this woman.</p>
<p>在某种意识层面，男性本能地察觉到这种情境存在问题，尽管他们可能无法明确为何有此感觉，或在女性对此情境的辩解中感到困惑而误解。或者，他们因社会压力要求“做正确的事”而感到沮丧，被迫陷入牺牲/救赎的角色，并承担起对这些传统规范的虚假责任。尽管如此，有些人通过先前经历或观察到其他男性背负起抚养与供养——无论参与度如何——另一个男人与该女性成功繁衍后代的责任，从而明智地选择避开单亲妈妈。</p>
<p>Men often fall into the role of the proactive or reactive Cuckold. He will never enjoy the same benefits as his mates short term partner(s) to the same degree, in the way of sexual desire or immediacy of it, while at the same time enduring the social pressures of having to provide for this Good Genes father’s progeny. It could be argued that he may contribute minimally to their welfare, but on some level, whether emotional, physical, financial or educational he will contribute some effort for another man’s genetic stock in exchange for a limited form of sexuality/intimacy from the mother. To some degree, (even if only by his presence) he is sharing the parental investment that should be borne by the short term partner. If nothing else, he contributes the time and effort to her he could be better invested in finding a sexual partner with which he could pursue his own genetic imperative by his own methodology.</p>
<p>男性常常陷入主动或被动的绿帽角色。他永远无法像伴侣的短期伴侣那样，在性欲望或即时性方面享受到同等程度的满足，同时还要承受着为这位“优质基因”父亲的后代提供生活保障的社会压力。可以说，他对这些后代的福祉贡献甚微，但在某种层面上，无论是情感、身体、经济还是教育方面，他都会为另一个男人的基因库付出一些努力，以换取母亲有限的性或亲密形式。在某种程度上，（即使仅仅是通过他的存在）他分担了本应由短期伴侣承担的父母投资。若非如此，他投入的时间和精力本可以更好地用于寻找一个能通过自己的方式追求自身基因传承的性伴侣。</p>
<p>However, needless to say, there is no shortage of men sexually deprived enough to ‘see past’ the long term disadvantages, and not only rewarding, but reinforcing a single mother’s bad decisions (bad from his own interest’s POV) with regard to her breeding selections and schedules in exchange for short term sexual gratification. Furthermore, by reinforcing her behavior thusly, he reinforces the social convention for both men and women. It’s important to bear in mind that in this age women are ultimately, soley responsible for the men they choose to mate with (baring rape of course) AND giving birth to their children. Men do bear responsibility for their actions no doubt, but it is ultimately the decision of the female and her judgement that decides her and her children’s fate</p>
<p>然而，毋庸置疑，不乏有性需求极度匮乏的男性，他们能够“忽视”长期的不利因素，不仅奖励，还强化了单身母亲在生育选择和时间安排上的错误决策（从他自身利益的角度来看是错误的），以换取短期的性满足。此外，通过这种方式强化她的行为，他也强化了男女双方的社会规范。需要铭记的是，在这个时代，女性最终要独自承担起选择伴侣（当然不包括强奸的情况）和生育子女的责任。男性无疑要为自己的行为负责，但最终决定女性及其孩子命运的，是女性的选择和判断。</p>

<p><strong>Rejection is better than Regret.
拒绝胜于遗憾。</strong></p>
<p>Sifting through some of my past posts on the SoSuave forum it hit me; over 90% of what I advocate there can be reduced to overcoming a fear of rejection. 90% of the dilemmas AFCs and rAFCs find themselves in, and a majority of men’s concerns, with the opposite sex find their roots in the methods and means they use to reduce their exposure to female rejection. These are buffers meant to reduce the potential for this rejection of intimacy. Men of course aren’t the only ones who use buffers – women have their share as well – but I think it would be much more productive for guys to recognize this propensity in themselves and see the methods they use, and often ego-invest in their personal psychologies, to buffer themselves against rejection.</p>
<p>在回顾 SoSuave 论坛上的一些旧帖时，我突然意识到；我所倡导的 90%内容可以归结为克服对拒绝的恐惧。AFCs 和 rAFCs 所面临的 90%困境，以及大多数男性在与异性交往中的担忧，其根源在于他们用来减少面对女性拒绝风险的方法和手段。这些缓冲措施旨在降低这种亲密关系被拒绝的可能性。当然，使用缓冲措施的不仅仅是男性——女性也有自己的一套——但我认为，对男性而言，更有效的是认识到自身这种倾向，并审视他们所采用的方法，这些方法往往与他们的个人心理和自尊紧密相连，以此来抵御拒绝。</p>
<p>Virtually every common problem guys deal with finds its basis in these buffers:
几乎每个男性常遇问题都能在这些缓冲区中找到根源：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LDRs</strong> – Long Distance Relationships. The AFC will entertain an LDR because it was based on a previous acceptance of intimacy and being no longer convenient (due to distance) the guy will cling to the “relationship” because it’s a buffer against potential rejection from new women instead of accepting the relationship as being finished and maturely re-entering the dating pool. It’s a perceived “sure thing”, even if only rarely rewarding.  LDRs</li>
</ul>
<p>异地恋。AFC（挫男）会维持一段异地恋，因为这是基于之前对亲密关系的接受，而由于距离不再方便，男方会紧抓这段“关系”，将其作为抵御可能被新女性拒绝的缓冲，而非承认这段关系已结束，成熟地重新进入约会市场。这是一种被视为“稳妥”的选择，尽管很少带来回报。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Playing Friends</strong> – Usually after an LJBF rejection where the perception is the potential love interest “might” later become an intimate with time and qualification. No matter how misguided, the time and effort spent by an AFC in proving himself as the would-be “perfect boyfriend” is a buffer against further rejection by new potential females, which is then further compounded by a moralistic sense of duty to be an actual Friend to his LJBF girl. In essence, his buffer against further rejection is his misplaced dedication to the LJBF girl. Another variation of this is the Cap’n-Save-A-Ho dynamic.  玩伴关系——通常发生在“只是朋友”拒绝之后，此时潜在的爱情对象可能会随着时间和条件的成熟而变得亲密。无论这种想法多么错误，一个 AFC（平均水平的家伙）为了证明自己能成为“完美男友”所投入的时间和精力，成为他抵御新潜在女性拒绝的缓冲。这种缓冲进一步被他对 LJBF 女孩实际成为朋友的道德责任感所加强。本质上，他抵御进一步拒绝的缓冲是他错位的对 LJBF 女孩的奉献。另一种变体是“船长救妓”的动态。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emails, IMs and Texts</strong> – I should also add lengthy phone conversations to this list as well, but really any technology that seemingly increases communication serves as a buffer (for both genders) the more it limits interpersonal communication. In the AFC case, the rationalization is that it keeps him in constant contact with his sex interest (which in and of itself is a mistake), but only serves as a buffer against her rejection. The latent perception being that it’s easier to read a rejection (or hear one) than to potentially be rejected in person. A lot of guys will counter this with how Texts and IM’s are just how this generation plies its Game. The difference I’d argue is that when digital communication becomes your preferred method of interacting with women, it’s a buffer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>电子邮件、即时消息和短信——我也应该将长时间的电话交谈加入这个列表，但事实上，任何看似增加沟通的技术，随着它限制人际交流的程度加深，都成为了（对双方性别而言的）缓冲器。在 AFC（Average Frustrated Chump，即普通挫败者）的情况下，其合理化解释是，这使他始终与性兴趣对象保持联系（这本身就是一个错误），但实际上只是作为她拒绝的缓冲。潜在的认知是，阅读或听到拒绝比可能当面被拒绝要容易得多。许多男性会反驳说，短信和即时消息只是这一代人玩游戏的手段。我要争论的区别在于，当数字通信成为你与女性互动的首选方式时，它就成了一种缓冲。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Online Dating</strong> – This one should be fairly obvious for the same reasons as above – Online dating is perhaps the best buffer ever conceived – particularly for less than physically ideal women. In fact it’s so effective that businesses can be built upon the common insecurities and fear of rejection of both sexes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook 与在线交友——这一点应该相当明显，原因与上述相同——在线交友或许是迄今为止为女性，尤其是外表不那么理想的女性设计的最佳缓冲机制。事实上，它的效果如此显著，以至于可以基于两性共同的自我怀疑和害怕被拒绝的心理建立商业模式。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectification of Gender</strong> – This might be less obvious, but both sexes tend to objectify the other. Naturally when we think of this, the popularized notion is that men objectify women as sex objects, but women have a tendency to objectify men as “success objects” for the same reason. It is easier to accept rejection from an object than it is to take it from a living, breathing, human being. This is why we refer to intersexual communication as a “game.” We “score” or we get “shot down” not personally or emotionally rejected; the buffer is in the language and mental approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>性别物化——这一点可能不那么明显，但两性都倾向于物化对方。通常当我们想到这一点时，流行的观念是男性将女性物化为性对象，但出于同样的原因，女性也有将男性物化为“成功对象”的倾向。从物化对象那里接受拒绝，比从活生生的人那里接受拒绝要容易得多。这就是为什么我们将异性间的交流称为“游戏”。我们“得分”或被“拒绝”，并非个人或情感上的拒绝；这种缓冲存在于语言和心理层面。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idealization of Gender</strong> – This is the myth of the “Quality Woman.” The buffer operates in perceived self-limitations based on a search for an ideal mate. Thus a tendency to fixate on one woman (ONEitis) or one type of woman (a gender Archetype) develops. By limiting to, and/or fixating on one woman (or type) the potential for rejection decreases, while insuring that any real rejection will come only from what will later be deemed non-qualified women. Rejection = ‘Low Quality Woman’ and is thus disqualified. This works in a similar fashion to the objectification buffer in that the woman delivering the rejection is reduced to an object.</li>
</ul>
<p>性别理想化——这是“优质女性”的神话。缓冲器基于对理想伴侣的追求，在感知到的自我限制中运作。因此，倾向于固定于一位女性（单一情结）或一种女性类型（性别原型）。通过限制和/或固定于一位女性（或类型），拒绝的可能性降低，同时确保任何实际的拒绝只会来自后来被视为不合格的女性。拒绝等于“低质量女性”，因此被取消资格。这与物化缓冲器的作用类似，即发出拒绝的女性被降格为物体。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scarcity Mentality</strong> – The “Take What I Can Get and Be Glad I Got It” mentality acts as a buffer in that it works opposite of the Idealization buffer. Deprivation is motivation, and by sticking with the “sure thing” as the “only thing”, the potential for new rejection is then eliminated.  稀缺心态——“能得到什么就拿什么，并庆幸自己得到了”的心态起到了缓冲作用，因为它与理想化缓冲相反。匮乏成为动力，通过坚持“确定的事物”作为“唯一的事物”，从而消除了新拒绝的可能性。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Older Women, Younger Women</strong> – I should also include certain body types in this category as well, but the buffer is in certain types of women being less likely to reject a man due to their personal circumstances. The Cougar dynamic debate has been done into irrelevancy, but the buffer is that older women, acting in accordance with their conditions, will be more inclined to accept the advances of younger men. In the same vein, very young girls will be more apt to accept the advances of older men due to naiveté and fat women are easier to become intimate with due to sexual deprivation. This isn’t rocket science, but an internalized preference for particular women develop by associating that particular type of woman with the minimization for potential rejection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>年长女性与年轻女性——这一类别中还应包括某些体型，但缓冲因素在于某些类型的女性因个人情况而较少拒绝男性。关于“猎豹”动态的辩论已变得无关紧要，但缓冲因素是，年长女性根据自身条件，更倾向于接受年轻男性的追求。同样地，非常年轻的女孩由于天真无知，更容易接受年长男性的追求；而体型较胖的女性则因性压抑更容易与男性建立亲密关系。这并非高深莫测的科学，而是通过将特定类型的女性与减少潜在拒绝的可能性相联系，从而形成的内在偏好。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leagues</strong> – This is the opposite of a “high standards” buffer which could be grouped with Scarcity. There is the woman some guys actually fear because she is perceived to be so much more socially valuable than the AFC. Think of the HB9+ corporate director who runs marathons, travels a lot, has good friends, dresses well, etc, etc, etc. The AFC tells himself “wow is she out of my league I would just get shot down because I would need to possess A, B &amp; C to be her social status equal for her to even be interested”.  Ergo, the idea of Leagues is a useful rationalization buffer against rejection.</li>
</ul>
<p>等级——这与“高标准”缓冲相反，可以与稀缺性归为一类。有些男人实际上害怕这样的女人，因为她被认为在社交价值上远超普通男人。想象一下那位 HB9+级别的企业主管，她跑马拉松、经常旅行、拥有好友、穿着得体等等。普通男人会对自己说：“哇，她超出了我的等级，我只会被拒绝，因为要让她感兴趣，我需要具备 A、B 和 C 才能与她的社交地位相匹配。”因此，“等级”这一概念是一种有用的合理化缓冲，以避免被拒绝。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pornography</strong> I realize this will draw some fire from the masturbation / no-masturbation set, but porn (as men use it) is a Buffer against rejection. Porn doesn’t talk back, porn doesn’t need a few drinks to loosen up nor does porn require any social skills to produce rewards. It’s convenient, immediate, sexual release that requires nothing more than a PC and an internet connection (or a magazine if you prefer the analog means). We can argue the obsessive-compulsive aspect of it, or the “my GF and I enjoy porn together” reasoning, but for the single guy the root reasoning is its facility as a Buffer. I should also add that it’s this very facility that makes women hate it (when they do). Porn gives a guy his reward for free; a reward that should be her single best agency is rendered valueless when a man can get off to an infinite variety of sexual experience at the click of a mouse. It’s unlimited access to unlimited sexual availability without the stress of learning methods to earn it as a reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>色情内容，我意识到这会引来自慰/非自慰群体的一些批评，但色情（男性使用的方式）是一种拒绝的缓冲器。色情不会回嘴，不需要几杯酒来放松，也不需要任何社交技巧来产生回报。它方便、即时，只需一台电脑和互联网连接（或一本杂志，如果你偏好模拟方式）就能提供性释放。我们可以争论其强迫症倾向，或是“我和女友一起享受色情”的理由，但对单身男性而言，根本原因在于它作为缓冲器的便利性。我还应补充，正是这种便利性使得女性（当她们讨厌时）憎恨色情。色情让男性免费获得回报；这种本应是女性最强优势的回报，在男性只需点击鼠标就能体验无限多样性爱时变得毫无价值。它提供了无限制的性可获得性，无需学习获取奖励的方法，从而免除了压力。</p>
<p>These are really just a few notable examples, but once you become aware of how buffers manifest you’ll begin to see how and why they are useful against rejection. Buffers are generally the paths of least rejection that become ego-invested “preferences.” Buffers aren’t so much about those “preference” as they are about the motivations behind them.</p>
<p>这些只是少数显著的例子，但一旦你意识到缓冲机制是如何显现的，你就会开始理解它们为何以及如何在抵御排斥中发挥作用。缓冲通常是那些排斥最小的路径，逐渐成为自我投入的“偏好”。缓冲机制的关键不在于那些“偏好”本身，而在于它们背后的动机。</p>
<p>At this point you might be thinking, “well, what the hell, I don’t want to feel rejection, why not employ buffers against it?” The main reason for embracing rejection is that <strong>rejection is better than regret</strong>. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would’ve been? Buffers also have a tendency to compound upon themselves in that one tends to dovetail into another, or more, until you no longer realize that they were originally rejection prevention methodologies and gradually become associated with your genuine personality. After a long enough period, these buffer become “just how I am.”</p>
<p>此时你或许会想：“好吧，管它呢，我不想感受拒绝，为何不采取缓冲措施来避免呢？”拥抱拒绝的主要原因在于，拒绝总好过后悔。回顾一下这份简短的缓冲措施清单；其中有多少项给你带来了比短暂痛苦的拒绝更大的长期问题？缓冲措施还有个倾向，就是会相互叠加，一个接一个，甚至更多，直到你不再意识到它们最初是为了防止拒绝而采取的手段，并逐渐与你的真实个性相融合。经过足够长的时间，这些缓冲措施就变成了“我就是这样的”。</p>
<p>Lastly, experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best. Rejection, real, raw, in your face rejection stings like a bitch. It must be something so intolerable that human beings will devise countless social and psychological constructs in order to avoid it. However, there is no better teacher than getting burned by the stove. As a Man, you are going to face rejection in far more facets of your life than just dealing with a woman. The buffers you learn in one aspect of your life will be just as encumbering when they’re transferred to another aspect of your life. All of these buffers listed, and many more, become indicators of how you confidently deal with adversity. Some make you look like a beta-herb pussy, others are subtle and nagging parts of an internalized personality, but dependence upon them incrementally reveals your real character to a woman. Are you Alpha enough to take a rejection on the chin, smile and confidently come back for more? Or will you run, will you block yourself, will you hide with convenient buffers?</p>
<p>最后，经验教训虽严酷，却最为深刻。那种真切、赤裸、直面而来的拒绝，犹如毒刺般令人痛苦。它必定是如此难以忍受，以至于人类会设计无数社会和心理结构来避免它。然而，没有什么比被火炉烫伤更能教会你远离危险。作为男人，你将在生活的更多方面遭遇拒绝，而不仅仅是在与女性打交道时。你在某一生活领域学到的缓冲技巧，在转移到另一领域时同样会成为负担。所有这些缓冲手段，以及更多未列出的，都成为你如何自信应对逆境的标志。有些让你显得像个软弱的跟班，有些则是内化性格中微妙而持续的部分，但依赖它们会逐渐向女性揭示你的真实本性。你是否足够强大，能坦然接受拒绝，微笑着自信地再次尝试？还是会逃避、自我封闭、躲在便利的缓冲背后？</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="imagination"><a class="header" href="#imagination">Imagination</a></h1>
<p>A woman’s imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal. Every technique, every casual response, every gesture, intimation and subcommunication hinges on stimulating her imagination. Competition anxiety relies on it. DHV relies on it. Sexual tension (gina tingles) relies on it. Call it “Caffeinating the Hamster” if you will, but stimulating a woman’s imaginings is the single most potent talent you can learn in any context of a relationship (LTR, STR, ONS, Plate Spinning.)
女性的想象力是你游戏武器库中最有用的单一工具。每一种技巧、每一个随意的回应、每一个手势、暗示和潜沟通都依赖于激发她的想象力。竞争焦虑依赖于它。展示高价值依赖于它。性张力（吉娜的颤动）依赖于它。如果你愿意，可以称之为“给仓鼠加咖啡”，但在任何关系情境中（长期关系、短期关系、一夜情、盘旋），激发女性的想象力是你能学到的最强大的技能。</p>
<p>This is the single greatest failing of average frustrated chumps; they vomit out everything about themselves, divulging the full truth of themselves to women in the mistaken belief that women desire that truth as a basis for qualifying for their intimacy. Learn this now: <strong>Women NEVER want full disclosure</strong>. Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think she’s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination).</p>
<p>这是普通挫败者的最大败笔；他们毫无保留地倾吐自我，向女性透露全部真相，误以为女性渴望以此作为亲近的基础。现在就明白这一点：女性绝不需要完全坦白。对女性而言，没有什么比仅凭她那神秘的女性直觉（即想象力）自以为看透一个男人更令人满足的了。</p>
<p>When a man overtly confirms his character, his story, his value, etc. for a woman, the mystery is dispelled and the bio-chemical rush she enjoyed from her imaginings, her suspicions, her self-confirmations about you are GONE. AFCs classically do exactly this on the first date and wonder why they get LJBF’d promptly after it – this is why. Familiarity is anti-seductive. Nothing kills Game, lust and libido like comfortable familiarity. Despite their common bleating filibuster tactics, women don’t want to be comfortable with a potential (or proven) sex partner, they need their imaginations stoked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with a potential partner.</p>
<p>当一个男人向女性明确展示他的性格、故事、价值等时，神秘感便消失了，她从想象、猜疑以及自我确认中获得的生物化学冲动也随之消散。"AFCs"（平均挫男）通常在初次约会时就犯下这个错误，随后困惑为何会立即被"LJBF"（Let's Just Be Friends，仅限朋友）对待——原因就在于此。熟悉感是反诱惑的。没有什么比舒适的熟悉感更能扼杀游戏、欲望和性欲了。尽管女性常用喋喋不休的拖延战术，但她们并不希望与潜在（或已证实的）性伴侣感到舒适，她们需要被激发想象力，以感到兴奋、被唤醒并渴望与潜在伴侣发生性关系。</p>
<p>In an LTR there’s an even more critical need to keep prodding that imagination. I would go so far as to say it’s imperative for a healthy relationship, but then you’ll ask, how do you go about that when your LTR GF or wife already knows your story and the familiarity becomes cemented in?</p>
<p>在长期关系（LTR）中，保持激发想象力显得尤为关键。我甚至可以说，这对于一段健康的关系是必不可少的。但接下来你会问，当你的长期伴侣，无论是女友还是妻子，已经熟知你的故事，熟悉感已然根深蒂固时，你该如何着手呢？</p>
<p>The easy answer is never let it be from the outset – <strong>the health of any LTR you might entertain depends and survives on the frame you enter into it with.</strong> The foundations of a healthy LTR are laid while you’re single and dating non-exclusively. I’ve yet to meet the guy who’s told me he’s getting more frequent, more intense sex after his LTR / Marriage / Live-in situation was established. The primary reason for this is the relaxation of the competition anxiety that made the urgency of fucking you with lustful abandon in your dating phase an imperative to get you to commit to her frame. And that’s the crux of the matter that so many guys fail in, they surrender the frame BEFORE they commit to an LTR. They believe, (thanks to their Matrix conditioning) that commitment is synonymous with acquiescing to her frame control. Combine this with anti-seductive familiarity and the growing commonness of your own value because of it, and you can see exactly why her sexual interest wanes.</p>
<p>简单答案是，从一开始就不让它发生——你所考虑的任何长期关系（LTR）的健康与否，取决于你进入这段关系时的框架。一个健康 LTR 的基础是在你单身且非独占性约会期间奠定的。我至今未遇到过有人告诉我，在 LTR/婚姻/同居关系确立后，他的性生活变得更频繁、更激烈。主要原因在于，约会阶段因竞争焦虑而产生的迫切需要，即以激情放纵的方式与你发生关系以促使你接受她的框架，这种紧迫感随着关系的稳定而放松了。这就是许多男性失败的关键所在，他们在承诺进入 LTR 之前就放弃了框架。他们错误地认为（受矩阵式思维影响），承诺等同于屈服于她的框架控制。再加上反诱惑的熟悉感和因之而来的自身价值的普遍化，不难理解为何她的性趣会逐渐减退。</p>
<p>So what do you do to prevent that? First and foremost, understand that whose frame you enter into an LTR sets the foundation of that LTR. If you find yourself buying into an “it’s women’s world and we just live in it” mentality where your default presumption is that commitment means she wins, you lose and that’s just how it is, don’t even consider an LTR. She enters your world, not the other way around.</p>
<p>那么，你如何预防这种情况呢？首先，最重要的是要明白，你进入谁的框架决定了长期关系的基础。如果你发现自己陷入了“这是女人的世界，我们只是生活在其中”的心态，默认假设是承诺意味着她赢你输，而且事情本就如此，那么根本不要考虑长期关系。是她进入你的世界，而非相反。</p>
<p>Secondly, you need to cultivate an element of unpredictability about yourself prior to, and into, an LTR. Always remember POOK’s proverb, <strong>Perfect is BORING</strong>. Women will cry a river about wanting Mr. Dependable and then go off to fuck Mr. Exciting. In an LTR it’s necessary to be both, but not one at the expense of the other. Too many married men are TERRIFIED to rock the excitement boat with their wives because their sex lives hang in the balance of placating to her and her already preset frame. She must be reminded daily why you’re fun, unpredictable and exciting, not only to her, but other women as well. This requires covertly implying that other women find you desirable. Women crave the chemical rush that comes from suspicion and indignation. If you don’t provide it, they’ll happily get it from tabloids, romance novels, The View, Tyra Banks or otherwise living vicariously through their single girlfriends.</p>
<p>其次，在进入长期关系（LTR）之前及之后，你需要培养自己的不可预测性。始终牢记 POOK 的格言：完美即乏味。女性会为渴望可靠先生而流泪，转头却投入激情先生的怀抱。在 LTR 中，你需要同时兼具两者，而非牺牲其一。太多已婚男士因担心性生活受影响而不敢与妻子制造惊喜，他们的性福悬于迁就她及她既定的框架之上。你必须每日提醒她，为何你既有趣、不可预测又充满激情，不仅对她如此，对其他女性亦然。这需要巧妙暗示其他女性对你抱有好感。女性渴望由猜疑与愤慨带来的化学刺激。若你不提供这些，她们会乐意从八卦杂志、言情小说、《观点》节目、泰拉·班克斯秀或通过单身闺蜜的生活中获得这种体验。</p>
<p>By playfully staying her source of that rush you maintain the position of stimulating her imagination. Married men, who were defeated before they committed, don’t think that elements of Game apply to marriage out of fear of upsetting their wives frame, when in fact C&amp;F and Negs and many other aspects of Game work wonderfully. Just kicking her in the ass or busting her chops, playfully, is sometimes enough to send the message that you’re fearless of her response. You can break her frame with cockiness and the imaginings that come with it.</p>
<p>通过巧妙地保持这种刺激的源泉，你维持了激发她想象力的地位。已婚男士，在承诺之前就已败下阵来，往往因害怕破坏妻子的框架而不认为游戏中的元素适用于婚姻，而实际上，挑战与顺从、否定以及其他许多游戏中的策略都能发挥出色。只需轻松地踢她一脚或调侃几句，有时便足以传达出你无惧她反应的信息。你可以用自信和随之而来的想象打破她的框架。</p>
<p>Breaking from an established, predictable familiarity is often a great way to fire her imagination. Married guys will report how sexual their wives become after they get to the gym and start shaping up after a long layoff (or for the first time). It’s easy to pass this off as looking better makes women more aroused (which is true), but underneath that is the breaking of a pattern. You’re controllable and predictable so long as you’re pudgy and listless – what other woman would want you? But start changing your patterns, get into shape, make more money, get a promotion, improve and demonstrate your higher value in some appreciable way and the imagination and competition anxiety returns.</p>
<p>打破既定的、可预测的熟悉感，往往是激发她想象力的绝佳方式。已婚男士们会讲述，他们的妻子在长时间休息后（或首次）开始健身并塑形后，变得多么性感。人们很容易将此归因于外表改善使女性更兴奋（这确实没错），但更深层次的原因在于打破了固有模式。只要你肥胖且无精打采，你就是可控且可预测的——还有哪个女人会对你感兴趣呢？但一旦你开始改变模式，锻炼身材，增加收入，获得晋升，以某种可感知的方式提升并展示你的高价值，她的想象力和竞争焦虑便会重新被激发。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="social-matching-theory"><a class="header" href="#social-matching-theory">Social Matching Theory</a></h1>
<p>How to spot a rich guy
如何识别富豪</p>
<p>We laugh our asses off at this joke, but why is it funny? It is funny because human beings, like many other higher order animals, have the innate ability to make cognitive comparisons on a subconscious level. The reason it’s humorous is because we see an imbalance in a system and make deductive conclusions with regard to individual conditions. This is the basis of the Social Matching Theory.
我们被这个笑话逗得捧腹大笑，但为何它如此滑稽？其幽默之处在于，人类与其他高等动物一样，拥有一种与生俱来的能力，即在潜意识层面进行认知比较。这种幽默感的来源，是因为我们察觉到了系统中的不平衡，并据此对个体状况做出推断性结论。这便是社会匹配理论的基石。</p>
<p>Social Matching Theory, in essence, is defined as follows: All things being equal, an individual will tend to be attracted to, and are more likely to pair off with, another individual who is of the same or like degree of physical attractiveness as themself.
社交匹配理论，实质上可定义如下：在所有条件相同的情况下，个体往往倾向于被与自己外貌吸引力相当或相似的另一人所吸引，并更有可能与之配对。</p>
<p>Just as an aside, this is a well recognized social psychology theory, not something manufactured by Game theorists. However, in a nutshell it outlines the sexual marketplace dynamic, before adding variables like Game, status, provisioning, etc.
顺便提一下，这是一个广受认可的社会心理学理论，并非由博弈论者所杜撰。简而言之，它概述了性市场的动态，随后才引入诸如博弈、地位、供养等变量。</p>
<p>This is a naturally occuring commonality among many specific aculturations and societies. The trick to this theory is of course that ‘All Things’ are rarely equal. However, my point to this isn’t to naively assume that attraction and sexual pairing happen in a vacuum – far from it. It is to illustrate an underlying psycho-biological principle that operates beneath our consciousness that prompts other psychological schemas from an intimately personal (micro) level to the social psychology of an entire (macro) culture.
这是许多特定文化适应和社会中自然存在的共性。这一理论的诀窍在于，“万物”很少是平等的。然而，我的观点并非天真地假设吸引和性配对发生在真空中——远非如此。而是为了阐明一个潜藏在我们的意识之下，从个人亲密（微观）层面到整个（宏观）文化社会心理的心理生物学原理，它促使其他心理模式得以形成。</p>
<p>As I’ve posted in several forum threads with regard to “Why Women Cheat” or why men are so compelled toward sex with archetypically attractive women, the root of this desire is a psychologically evolved  opportunism that is founded on our ability to make and assess these natural comparissons in order to better facilitate our own survival and the survival of our offspring. It has served our species so well over  millennia that this natural comparisson making capacity has become an autonomous and subconscious aspect of experiencing our environment. We understand that eating a large apple is preferable, from a survial standpoint, to eating the small one. We have a tendency to want what our biologies compel us towards and develop idealizations based on what we think would best satisfy these ends.
正如我在多个论坛帖子里关于“女性为何出轨”或男性为何如此迷恋典型美女的问题上所提到的，这种欲望的根源是一种心理上进化的机会主义，它建立在我们能够进行并评估这些自然比较的能力之上，以便更好地促进我们自身及后代的生存。这种自然比较的能力经过千百年的演化，已成为我们体验环境时一种自主且潜意识的部分。从生存角度来看，我们知道吃一个大苹果比吃一个小苹果更有利。我们倾向于追求生物本能驱使我们想要的东西，并根据我们认为最能满足这些需求的事物来形成理想化的观念。</p>
<p>As I stated, I understand that attraction and intersexual relations do not happen in a vacumm and there are many (generally predictable) variables that influence this, but Social Matching Theory isn’t about the process of attraction or pairing so much as the motivations for selection. I’m often asked about the importance placed on physical appearance, prowess, etc. bearing influence on attraction, and I can speak from my own experience saying yes, it absolutely does. A fat guy is simply not going to attract a Fitness America competitor without some very unique circumstances influencing this attraction. Neither would I support this attraction being based in a qualitative, genuine physical desire for the fat male. It is an imbalance in a system.
正如我所言，我理解吸引与两性关系并非在真空中发生，存在诸多（通常可预测的）变量影响这一过程，但社会匹配理论更多关注的是选择动机，而非吸引或配对过程本身。我常被问及外貌、体能等因素对吸引力的影响程度，我可以根据个人经验肯定地说，确实有显著影响。一个肥胖的男性若非在极其特殊的情境下，是难以吸引到健身比赛选手的。同样，我也不认为这种吸引是基于对肥胖男性的真正身体欲望。这实际上是系统中的失衡现象。</p>
<p>All things being equal; socio-economic, intellectual, emotional levels etc. you will have a tendency to attract and be attracted to people of similar physical presence as yourself. This is the root of the psychological schema many men and women apply when they follow the “He/She’s out of my leauge” mentality. They are manifesting this subconscious understanding that the prospects of another person of a more idealized physical presence being attracted to them or pairing with them would be an unlikely match. They self-perceive this imbalance and thus limit themselves to opportunities that have a better likelihood of success in gratifying their need – in this case sex.
在所有条件相同的情况下，包括社会经济、智力、情感水平等，你往往会吸引并被那些与你拥有相似外貌特征的人所吸引。这是许多男女在遵循“他/她超出了我的范畴”心态时所应用的心理模式的基础。他们正表现出这种潜意识的理解：一个外貌更理想化的人被他们吸引或与之配对的可能性不大。他们自我感知到这种不平衡，因此限制了自己在更有可能成功满足需求——在此情况下是性——的机会。</p>
<p>Look at the ‘Rich Guy’ picture again. The woman in this imbalance we might presume is a ‘Golddigger’. This too is inspired by an innate understanding of the Social Matching Theory. Why else would an (arguably) attractive woman in comparatively good shape, wearing a thong (indicating sexual availability), be with a morbidly obese male if he didn’t posess some other redeeming variable to inspire the match? We see a picture and laugh, and women make the internalized rationalization that she’s not genuinely interested in the guy, but is ‘in love’ with his provisioning means. Superficial? Perhaps, but it still illustrates this comparative instinct we have, particularly when we know nothing about individual circumstance. The possibility does exists that this woman genuinely loves the guy, or is attracted to him, but this isn’t our first impression. In fact it takes significant, trained, mental effort to consider the possibility because the Social Matching comparison IS our natural default.
再看那张“富豪”照片。我们或许会推测，在这段不平衡关系中的女性是个“拜金女”。这同样源自对社会匹配理论的内在理解。否则，一个（可以说）有魅力的、身材相对姣好的女性，穿着丁字裤（暗示性开放），怎会与一个病态肥胖的男性在一起，除非他拥有其他可弥补的特质来促成这段关系？我们看到照片会发笑，而女性内心则合理化地认为她并非真心喜欢这个男人，而是“爱上”了他的供养能力。肤浅吗？或许，但它仍揭示了我们这种比较本能，尤其是在对个体情况一无所知时。确实存在这种可能：这位女性真心爱着这个男人，或被他吸引，但这并非我们的第一印象。实际上，要考虑这种可能性需要大量的、经过训练的思维努力，因为社会匹配的比较是我们自然的默认思维。</p>
<p>Finally, I should add that the Social Matching Theory is also one of the primary foundations upon which AFCism and ONEitis is based. This natural fear of rejection associated with both of these schema stem from a subconscious understanding of this theory. ONEitis in particular can be traced back to this self-perception of imbalance leading to the “I’ll never find a better woman/man than this person” mentality in so much as it represents a limitation of opportunism. In other words, it becomes preferable for a person to stay and accomodate an otherwise intolerable relationship if that person has internalized the understanding that their relationship represents an imbalance in this Social Matching. Abuse endured from the more idealized mate becomes preferable to rejection from anonymous, less idealized sources of intimacy.
最后，我必须补充，社会匹配理论也是 AFC 主义和 ONEitis 的主要基础之一。这两种模式所关联的天然拒斥恐惧，源自对这一理论的潜意识理解。特别是 ONEitis，可以追溯到这种自我认知的不平衡，导致“我再也找不到比这个人更好的人”的心态，因为它代表了机会主义的局限。换句话说，如果一个人内化了这种社会匹配中的不平衡关系，那么即使一段关系原本难以忍受，他们也更倾向于留下来适应。忍受来自更理想化伴侣的虐待，变得比被匿名、不那么理想的亲密来源拒斥更可取。</p>
<p>At this point you may be wondering what brought this post to the surface. I recently got into a debate with a self-described feminist who entirely rejected notion that a sexual marketplace should even exist in contemporary human society. It wasn’t that she was denying the underlying dynamic of the sexual marketplace, but rather that it was an antiquated and dehumanizing influence in the human condition. Up until this conversation, I’d always taken the idea of a sexual marketplace and sexual market value as applied to individuals as a given. The SMP was a recognized universal framework in which we maneuver – some successfully, others with difficulty. The rejection of this idea, or the desire to alter it sociological, seems absurd to me, even though I would agree that it is a brutal game we play. My counterargument with her was that the SMP is actually more representative of our humanity, in that it’s healthier to accept that the way we evolved as a successful species was due to the harsh reality of the SMP. She wouldn’t hear it.
此时此刻，你或许会好奇是什么让这篇文章浮出水面。最近，我与一位自称为女权主义者的人展开了一场辩论，她完全否定了在当代人类社会中应存在性市场的观念。她并非否认性市场的底层动态，而是认为这一概念在人类境况中是一种过时且非人化的影响。在这次对话之前，我一直将性市场及个人性市场价值的概念视为理所当然。性市场体系（SMP）是我们公认的普遍框架，我们在此中运作——有些人游刃有余，有些人则步履维艰。对我而言，否定这一概念或试图从社会学角度改变它，似乎显得荒谬，即便我认同这是一个我们参与的残酷游戏。我的反驳是，SMP 实际上更体现了我们的人性，因为承认我们作为成功物种的进化之路是基于 SMP 的严酷现实，这更为健康。但她对此充耳不闻。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="alpha"><a class="header" href="#alpha">Alpha</a></h1>
<p>The Alpha Buddah, Corey Worthington.
阿尔法·布达，科里·沃辛顿。</p>
<p>What I’m about to type here is not going to make me any new friends. I know because any discussion of what constitutes Alpha characteristics in a Man always becomes clouded by the self-perceptions of how well we think we align with them. As I’ve covered in prior postings, the ‘community’, the ‘manosphere’, the new understanding of gender relations that’s picked up momentum for the last 12 years has always generated it’s own terminologies for more abstract concepts. The danger in this is that these terms lack real, universal definition. For purposes of illustrating a concept these terms are usually serviceable – we have a general understanding of what makes for a ‘Beta’ or a Herb, or a man who falls into a ‘provider’ mentality. Even ‘Alpha’ in a specific context is useful as an illustrative tool, when the subject isn’t directly about ‘Alpha-ness’. It’s when we try to universally define what constitutes Alpha that the sparks start to fly. So before you continue on reading further, think about what you believe makes a guy Alpha. Got it in your head now? Good, now put all of that aside, purge that from your head, and read the next few paragraphs from the perspective that you don’t know anything about Alpha.</p>
<p>我即将在此输入的内容不会为我赢得任何新朋友。我知道这一点，因为任何关于男性 Alpha 特质构成的讨论总是被我们对自己与这些特质相符程度的自我认知所模糊。正如我在之前的帖子中所述，“社群”、“男性圈”以及过去 12 年里势头渐起的性别关系新理解，总是为更抽象的概念创造自己的术语。这种做法的危险在于，这些术语缺乏真正普遍的定义。为了说明一个概念，这些术语通常是可行的——我们对什么是“Beta”或“草本”，或陷入“供养者”心态的男性有一个大致的理解。即使在特定情境下，“Alpha”作为一个说明工具也是有用的，尤其是当话题并非直接关于“Alpha 特质”时。正是当我们试图普遍定义什么是 Alpha 时，争议才开始四起。因此，在你继续阅读之前，思考一下你认为什么使一个男人成为 Alpha。现在脑海中有答案了吗？ 好的，现在请将这些内容暂时搁置，从脑海中清除，并从对 Alpha 一无所知的角度阅读接下来的几段文字。</p>
<p>I was first introduced to the Alpha Buddah courtesy of Roissy and this post “Umm, sorry?” You can go ahead and read this from the Chateau’s perspective, and I think the analysis is pretty good. I call Corey the Alpha Buddah not in the hopes that men will aspire to his almost Zen like ‘being’ in Alpha, but rather to provide an example of Alpha in it’s most pure form. He literally IS Alpha, unclouded by pretense, afterthought, or conscious awareness of any influence that could have a hope of prompting introspection about his state.</p>
<p>我首次接触到 Alpha Buddha 这一概念，得益于 Roissy 以及这篇博文“嗯，抱歉？”你可以从 Chateau 的角度去阅读并理解，我认为其分析相当到位。我将 Corey 称为 Alpha Buddha，并非期望男性们去模仿他那种近乎禅宗般的 Alpha 存在状态，而是旨在展示 Alpha 本质的最纯粹形态。他简直就是 Alpha 的化身，不受任何矫饰、事后思考或自觉意识的影响，这些因素本可能引发对他自身状态的反思。</p>
<p>Corey Worthington is a piss poor example of a human being, but he’s a textbook example of Alpha. I could use a lot of adjectives to describe this kid, but “beta” wouldn’t be one of them. What’s funny, and a bit ironic, is this kid has probably never come across Mystery Method or “the community” or even heard of ‘peacocking’ and he gets naturally what millions of guys pay small fortunes at PUA seminars to acquire over the course of a lifetime. He’s a selfish little prick, but what makes him insulting to ‘normal’ men is his having the natural, internalized Alpha bravado so many AFCs wish they had. If you could bottle and sell this Alpha essence, you’d be rich beyond imagine.</p>
<p>科里·沃辛顿是一个糟糕透顶的人类样本，但他却是阿尔法（Alpha）的典型范例。我可以用许多形容词来描述这个孩子，但“贝塔（Beta）”绝不在其中。有趣且略带讽刺的是，这孩子可能从未接触过《神秘方法》或“社区”，甚至没听说过“孔雀开屏”，却自然而然地掌握了无数男性花费毕生精力在 PUA 研讨会上追求的技能。他是个自私的小混蛋，但他对“正常”男性的侮辱之处在于，他天生就拥有许多挫男（AFC）梦寐以求的内在化阿尔法自信。如果能将这种阿尔法特质装瓶出售，你将富可敌国。</p>
<p>Right about now all of those self-affirming preconceptions you had about Alpha-ness (that I told you to stow away before reading this) are probably yelling to be let out of the mental box you put them in. “,..but, but Rollo, how can you possibly think this arrogant douchebag kid could ever be an example of anything remotely Alpha?!” You’ll be pleased to know I fully empathize your outrage. You work hard to be a “better man”, you put in the self analysis, you paid your dues coming to terms with unplugging and reinventing yourself. You’re a success, Corey is fuck-up. Corey’s not a better Man than you are, however, he understands Alpha better than you do.</p>
<p>就在此刻，你心中那些关于 Alpha 特质的自我肯定的预设（我之前让你在阅读本文前先搁置一边）可能正大声疾呼，想要从你心里的那个小盒子里挣脱出来。“但是，但是，Rollo，你怎么可能认为这个自大狂妄的小子能成为任何接近 Alpha 特质的例子呢？！”你将会高兴地知道，我完全理解你的愤怒。你努力成为一个“更好的男人”，你进行了自我剖析，你付出了代价，接受了自我重塑的过程。你是成功的，而 Corey 是个失败者。Corey 并不比你更优秀，然而，他比你更懂得 Alpha 的含义。</p>
<p>Alpha is mindset, not a demographic.
阿尔法是一种思维方式，而非特定人群。</p>
<p>Alpha is as Alpha does, it isn’t what we say it is. There are noble Alphas and there are scoundrel Alphas, the difference is all in how they apply themselves. There’s a tendency to approach every “Alpha” argument from what a guy thinks is righteousness; ergo, his personal definition of Alpha is what appeals best to his sense of virtue. He earned his Alpha cred, played by the rules, and by God people (women) should respect that. However, the sad truth is that prisons are full of Alpha males who simply channeled their drive toward destructive and anti-social endeavors. There are plenty of examples of indifferent Asshole Alphas who you wouldn’t say are upstanding moral leaders at all, yet women will literally kill each other (or themselves) in order to bang them because they exude a natural Alpha-ness. Just as Corey does here. There are Alpha drug dealing gang leaders, and there are Alpha husbands, fathers and leaders of industry. It’s all in the application. Genghis Khan was Alpha as fuck, and a leader-of-men, but probably would be on most people’s douchebag list for that era. Here’s an illustration:
阿尔法的行为定义了阿尔法，而非我们口中的定义。有高尚的阿尔法，也有卑鄙的阿尔法，区别全在于他们如何运用自己。人们往往从个人认为的正义角度来解读每一个“阿尔法”争论；因此，他个人对阿尔法的定义最能迎合他的道德感。他凭借规则赢得了阿尔法的声誉，人们（尤其是女性）理应对此表示尊重。然而，可悲的现实是，监狱里满是那些将动力导向破坏性和反社会行为的阿尔法男性。不乏冷漠的混蛋阿尔法，你绝不会认为他们是道德楷模，但女性们却会为了与他们发生关系而争斗甚至自残，因为他们散发着自然的阿尔法气质。正如科里在这里所展现的。有贩毒团伙的阿尔法头目，也有阿尔法的丈夫、父亲和行业领袖。一切都取决于应用方式。成吉思汗无疑是极具阿尔法特质的领袖，但他很可能在当时大多数人眼中是个混蛋。这里有个例子：</p>
<p>Guy’s like Corey infuriate men who have invested their self-worth in the accomplishments of what they think ought to be universally appreciated and rewarded. So when they’re confronted with a natural Alpha being undeservedly rewarded for brazenly acting out of accord with what they think the rules ought to be, they seethe with resentment. The natural response in the face of such an inconsistency is to redefine the term ‘Alpha’ to cater to themselves and their accomplishments as “real men” and exclude the perpetrator. The conflict then comes from seeing his new definition of Alpha not being rewarded or even appreciated as well as a natural Alpha attitude and the cycle continues. Your respect (or anyone else’s) for an Alpha has nothing to do with whether or not he possess an Alpha mindset. 3 failed marriages and 100+ lays has nothing to do with his having or not having an Alpha mindset. There are many well respected betas who’ve never had a passing thought of infidelity, or may have 300 lays either with prostitutes or because they possess fame or stunning good looks and women come to him by matter of course.</p>
<p>像 Corey 这样的人会激怒那些将自我价值投资于他们认为应得到普遍赞赏和回报的成就上的男性。因此，当他们面对一个自然 Alpha 因公然违反他们认为应遵守的规则而未受应得奖赏时，他们会充满怨恨。面对这种不一致，自然的反应是重新定义“Alpha”一词，以迎合他们自己及其作为“真正男人”的成就，并排除肇事者。冲突随之而来，因为他们看到自己对 Alpha 的新定义未得到奖赏或甚至未得到与自然 Alpha 态度相同的赞赏，循环往复。你对一个 Alpha 的尊重（或任何人的）与他是否拥有 Alpha 心态无关。三次失败的婚姻和超过 100 次的性经历与他是否拥有 Alpha 心态无关。有许多备受尊敬的 Beta，他们从未有过不忠的念头，或者可能与妓女或因拥有名声或惊人美貌而自然吸引女性有过 300 次性经历。</p>
<p>The take home message here is that you are not Alpha because of your achievements, you have your achievements because you are Alpha. You possess a mindset you either had to develop or it came naturally to you. I constantly field questions from young men asking me whether some action or behavior they displayed to a woman was Alpha, or Alpha enough. The real answer is that Alpha behaviors are manifestations of an Alpha mindset. And just like Corey the Alpha Buddah, the introspect required to wonder if something was or wasn’t Alpha wouldn’t ever be a consideration enough to ask. You almost need to have a childlike understanding to really appreciate what Alpha really is. Kids get Alpha. Even the picked on, introverted, beta-to-be kid has a better understanding of Alpha than most adult men do because he lacks the abstract thinking required to rationalize Alpha for himself. Most men, by our socialization, and to varying degrees, lose this in-born Alpha mindset over time. The naturals, the Corey’s of the world, have a better grasp on it’s usefulness and repurpose it; either to their adulthood advantage or their detriment.</p>
<p>这里的核心观点是，你并非因为成就而成为阿尔法，而是因为你是阿尔法才取得那些成就。你拥有一种心态，要么是后天培养的，要么是与生俱来的。我经常收到年轻男性的询问，想知道他们对女性展现的某种行为或举止是否足够阿尔法。真正的答案是，阿尔法行为是阿尔法心态的体现。就像阿尔法佛陀科里一样，那种需要反思是否某事是否阿尔法的念头，根本不值得去问。你几乎需要像孩子一样纯真的理解力，才能真正领悟阿尔法的真谛。孩子们懂得阿尔法。即使是那些被欺负、内向、即将成为贝塔的孩子，他们对阿尔法的理解也比大多数成年男性更深刻，因为他们缺乏抽象思维来为自己合理化阿尔法。随着时间的推移，大多数人在社会化的过程中，或多或少地失去了这种天生的阿尔法心态。那些天生的，比如科里这样的人，更懂得其价值并加以利用；无论是在成年后发挥优势还是带来不利。</p>

<p><strong>Spin more plates. 多转几只盘子。</strong></p>
<p>A lot of people get confused when I use this analogy and I thought it prudent to write a post on just what I mean in this regard.
很多人在我使用这个比喻时会感到困惑，我认为有必要写一篇文章来阐明我在这方面的意思。</p>
<p>A Man needs to have a lot of simultaneous prospects spinning together. Think of each plate as a separate woman you are pursuing. Some fall off and break, others you may wish to stop spinning altogether and some may not spin as fast as you’d like, but the essence of plate theory is that a man is as confident and valuable as his options. This is the essence of the abundance mindset – confidence is derived from options.
一个男人需要同时拥有许多正在发展的机会。将每个盘子视为一个你正在追求的独立女性。有些会掉落并破碎，有些你可能希望完全停止旋转，还有一些可能不会如你所愿地快速旋转，但盘子理论的精髓在于，一个人的自信和价值取决于他的选择。这就是富足心态的本质——自信源自选择。</p>
<p>This principle is the key to solving so many of the problems that dog the heels of beta AFCs and recovering AFCs. In fact I would say that this ideology should be the cornerstone to success for a man in many facets of life, not simply attracting and keeping women. A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will manifest itself. A man without options becomes necessitous and this leads to a lack of confidence and a scarcity mentality. Necessitous men are never free.
这一原则是解决众多困扰着 Beta 型 AFC 以及恢复期 AFC 问题的关键。事实上，我认为这种理念应成为男性在生活多方面取得成功的基石，而不仅仅是吸引和留住女性。拥有选择权的男人拥有力量，而这种选择权和力量感会自然地转化为自信。没有选择的男人则变得迫切需要，这导致缺乏自信和稀缺心态。迫切需要的男人永远无法自由。</p>
<p>The Cardinal Rule of Relationships
关系中的基本原则
In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.
在任何关系中，拥有最大权力的人往往是那个最不需要对方的人。</p>
<p>When a man spins more plates, when he has irons in the fire, when he is pursuing multiple women simultaneously, when he has options equally worth exploring, a man will have a natural, subconscious (but not exclusively) understanding that if one prospect does not expand, others very well may. This understanding has manifestations in a man’s behavior that women key on covertly. There are mannerisms and attitudes that a man with options will subconsciously convey to prospective women that they interpret, and give this man a value as a commodity to be competed for with other females.
当一个人同时处理多项事务，手头有多项计划，同时追求多位女性，拥有同样值得探索的选择时，他会自然而然、潜意识地（但不仅限于此）明白，如果一个前景无法拓展，其他前景很可能会有所发展。这种理解会在男性的行为中体现出来，而女性会暗中注意到这些迹象。拥有选择权的男性会不自觉地向潜在的女性传递某些举止和态度，这些女性会解读并赋予这位男性作为商品的价值，使其成为与其他女性竞争的对象。</p>
<p>On various sites in the PUA community, men are taught to emulate this behavior since it is a key element in attraction and interest. Cocky-Funny is one such technique that trains a confidence behavior that (more often than not) essentially masks a deficit of options. In other words, C&amp;F is a natural behavior for men with options that must be compensated for by those who don’t have an apptitude for it. This is why the ‘natural’ Alpha male seems to exude C&amp;F effortlessly while those without the benefit of more plates spinning (or the confidence in the ability of spinning more) struggle with simple things like eye contact or initiating approaches. This is also a fundamental principle in the “I don’t give a fuck” mentality that pervades community technique – it’s much easier to actually not “give a fuck” if you have other prospects going simultaneously.
在 PUA 社区的各个网站上，男性被教导模仿这种行为，因为它是吸引力和兴趣的关键要素。Cocky-Funny 就是这样一种技巧，它训练出一种自信行为，这种行为（多半时候）实质上掩盖了选择匮乏的缺陷。换句话说，C&amp;F 对于有选择权的男性来说是自然行为，而那些不具备这种天赋的人则必须通过补偿来实现。这就是为什么‘天生’的 Alpha 男性似乎能毫不费力地展现出 C&amp;F，而那些没有更多选择（或对旋转更多选择的能力缺乏信心）的人则在简单的行为如眼神接触或主动接近上感到困难。这也是“我不在乎”心态在社区技巧中普遍存在的一个基本原则——如果你同时有其他潜在对象，那么真正做到“不在乎”会容易得多。</p>
<p>Shotgun Logic 霰弹逻辑</p>
<p>One very important benefit that Plate Theory provides for a man is that it greatly curbs the propensity for ONEitis both in and out of an LTR.
盘理论为一个人带来的一个极其重要的好处是，它极大地抑制了在长期关系内外对单一对象的过度执着倾向。</p>
<p>Outside of an LTR, most guys subscribe to what I call the Sniper mentality. This is the AFC that applies all of his time, effort and resources to patiently waiting out his target, waiting for that perfect opportunity to summon enough courage in the most precise of conditions to take his one shot at the girl, who by then is the focus of his ONEitis. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years in extreme cases, but all the while he voluntarily sacrifices his most valuable of resource – potential opportunity. The man who subscribes to Plate Theory can more easily avoid this situation as he goes hunting for women with a Shotgun; scattering as much influence across the broadest area possible. While the AFC fishes with a single line and a single hook, the Plate Theorist fishes with a trolling net, selecting the fish worth keeping and tossing back those who aren’t.
在长期关系(LTR)之外，大多数男性遵循我所称的“狙击手心态”。这是那种普通追求者，他将所有时间、精力和资源都投入到耐心等待目标上，等待那个完美时机，在最为精准的条件下鼓足勇气，对那个女孩——那时已成为他唯一的执念——发起一次尝试。这个过程可能持续几周到极端情况下甚至几年，但在此期间，他自愿牺牲了他最宝贵的资源——潜在的机会。而遵循“盘子理论”的男性则更容易避免这种情况，他们像用猎枪一样去追求女性；尽可能广泛地散布影响力。当普通追求者用单线单钩钓鱼时，盘子理论者则用拖网捕鱼，挑选值得保留的，将不合适的放回。</p>
<p>Inside an LTR, Plate Theory becomes more specified. The AFC placates and identifies with his partner because the balance has shifted to her advantage since he reinforces her understanding that she is his only source of intimacy. I can’t think of a better recipe for ONEitis since he become progressively more dependent on her as his only source of intimacy. The man that maintains, at the very least, the covert perception of options, either professionally or on an intersexual level (i.e. social proof that other women will compete for him) maintains this power balance. Most successful men have an innate understanding of this and this explains their popular reservations for committing to marriage, In an LTR, Plate Theory becomes a subtle dance of perception and recognizing how your partner interprets understanding a particular man’s options, but regardless, it reduces a guy’s tendency to regress into ONEitis in an LTR from his own self-perception and the confidence int inspires.
在长期关系（LTR）中，板块理论变得更加具体化。AFC（平均挫男）会安抚并认同他的伴侣，因为平衡已向她倾斜，他强化了她作为他唯一亲密来源的认识。这无疑是“唯一症”（ONEitis）的绝佳配方，因为他会逐渐变得更加依赖她，视她为唯一的亲密来源。那些至少在潜意识里保持选择余地的男性，无论是在职业上还是在异性交往层面（即其他女性会为他竞争的社会证明），都能维持这种权力平衡。大多数成功的男性天生就理解这一点，这也解释了他们为何普遍对婚姻承诺持保留态度。在长期关系中，板块理论变成了一场微妙的感知之舞，需要识别伴侣如何解读一个特定男性的选择，但无论如何，这减少了男性在长期关系中因自我认知和由此激发的自信而退化为“唯一症”的倾向。</p>
<p>Natural Selection 自然选择</p>
<p>As I illustrated in the fishing net analogy, spinning more plates allows you more opportunity to select from the largest pool of prospective choices and date them or drop them as you see fit. This has two benefits. First, it serves as valuable, though non-committed, experience for learning what a man requires for his own personal satisfaction. Experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best and the breadth of experience serves a man well. Who’s insight is more beneficial, the man who’s sailed the world over or the man who’s never ventured beyond a lake? Secondly, opportunity and options make a man the PRIZE. Rock stars, professional athletes and movie stars aren’t irresistible to women because of their celebrity, but because they blatantly, and with the highest form of social proof, prove they have options that other women will jealously compete for as well as the confidence that this unconscious knowledge naturally manifests itself in them.
正如我在渔网比喻中所阐述的，旋转更多的盘子让你有机会从最大的潜在选择池中挑选，并根据你的意愿约会或放弃。这有两个好处。首先，它提供了宝贵的、尽管非承诺性的经验，用于学习一个男人为了个人满足所需的条件。经验虽然严酷，但教导得最为深刻，而经验的广度对一个人大有裨益。谁的洞察力更有益，是那个环游世界的男人，还是那个从未离开过湖泊的男人？其次，机会和选择使一个男人成为奖赏。摇滚明星、职业运动员和电影明星对女性来说并非不可抗拒，因为他们是名人，而是因为他们公然地、以最高形式的社会证明，证明他们有其他女性也会嫉妒地竞争的选择，以及这种无意识知识自然在他们身上展现出的自信。</p>
<p>What Plate Theory is not
什么是板块理论不是</p>
<p>My critics will often take a binary stance in their arguments with this idea citing that “they could never be with more than one woman at a time out of respect for her” or “so I should just lie to her and see other girls on the side?” To which I’d argue that these are feminized social conventions that attempt to thwart a man’s options in order to establish women as the prime selectors in intersexual relations. If it can be conditioned into a boy/man to ‘feel bad’ about seeing more than one woman at a time, it only better serves the female-as-chooser dynamic. To be sure, women are naturally the filters for their own intimacies, but it is essentially men who do the sexual selection. These convention’s latent purpose are designed to put selection of intimacy on a conditional basis that favors women, and as long as men will internalize this women will have a pre-constructed social high-ground.
我的批评者常常在辩论中采取二元立场，引用这样的观点：“出于对她的尊重，他们不可能同时与多个女性交往”，或者“所以我应该对她撒谎，同时与其他女孩交往吗？”对此，我会辩驳说，这些是试图限制男性选择、以确立女性在两性关系中为主要选择者的社会规范。如果能让男孩/男人对同时与多个女性交往感到“内疚”，这只会更有利于女性作为选择者的动态。诚然，女性自然地成为自身亲密关系的筛选者，但本质上进行性选择的仍是男性。这些规范的潜在目的旨在将亲密关系的选择置于有利于女性的条件基础上，只要男性内化这一点，女性就会拥有预先构建的社会优势地位。</p>
<p>The way to circumvent this dynamic is brutal honesty and a commitment to truthful, non-exclusivity with the plates you’re spinning. If you keep your options above board and are honest with any one girl and yourself about your choice to be non-exclusive, you not only remove the teeth from this convention, but you also reinforce yourself as a man with options (or at least perceived options). Further, critics will offer “well gee, if I did that with any woman she’d push off and dump me” to which I’ll refute – not if you establish this honestly from the outset. Most guys who’ve swallowed the ‘female power’ convention are too afraid or to preconditioned to even consider this as an option for seeing women. Letting a woman know, or covertly perceive, that you wont be exclusive to her pushes your commodity level up and implies options and potential success she’ll compete with other women to be associated with.
要绕过这种动态，需要的是坦诚和承诺，即对你正在旋转的盘子保持真实、非排他性。如果你公开自己的选择，并对任何一位女孩以及你自己诚实，表明你选择非排他性，你不仅削弱了这种惯例的威力，还强化了自己作为一个有选择（或至少被认为有选择）的男人的形象。此外，批评者可能会说：“哎呀，如果我对任何女人这样做，她会推开我并甩了我。”对此我会反驳——如果你从一开始就真诚地建立这种关系，情况并非如此。大多数接受了“女性力量”观念的男人过于害怕或过于先入为主，以至于根本不会考虑将这种方式用于与女性交往。让女性知道或隐约感知到你不会对她专一，会提升你的价值地位，暗示你有其他选择和潜在成功，这将促使她与其他女性竞争，以与你建立联系。</p>
<p>Plate Theory is also, most definitely not, a license to be indiscriminate with women. Just because you can spin a plate doesn’t necessarily mean you should spin that plate. Some aren’t worth spinning and a man with options should have no reservation about letting one go for a better one or two. In fact a man ought to be more discriminating in this regard since it affords him the best available from the largest selection.
板块理论也绝非意味着可以对女性不加选择。仅仅因为你能旋转一个板块，并不意味着你就应该旋转那个板块。有些并不值得旋转，一个有选择权的男人应该毫不犹豫地放弃一个，去追求更好的一两个。事实上，一个男人在这方面应该更加挑剔，因为这使他能从最大的选择范围中获得最佳选项。</p>

<p><em><strong>Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled by a faithful loser.</strong></em>
<em>女性宁愿与一个高价值男性分享，也不愿被一个忠诚的失败者拖累。</em></p>
<p>*<em>“I just started applying Plate Theory, and I have to say with all honesty that this is probably the best thing I’ve ever done in my entire life. The feeling of having options is addictive; the whole idea that you don’t come from a necessitous emotional state is genius, and in fact the more options you have, the more attractive you become to women (through the unconscious changes in your behavior), the more women become attracted to you, and the more options you have. Once you get it started, it’s hard to stop it.</em>
<em>“我刚开始运用板块理论，老实说，这可能是我一生中做过的最棒的事情。拥有选择的感觉令人上瘾；那种你并非出自需求情感状态的理念真是天才之举，事实上，你拥有的选择越多，通过你行为中潜移默化的改变，你对女性的吸引力就越大，反过来，吸引的女性越多，你的选择也就越多。一旦开始，就很难停下来。”</em></p>
<p><em>Recently I’ve been Spinning Plates with some success, but there comes a point when I risk one girl finding out about another. How do I handle this without the risk of losing one of my plates? Should I even bother with the effort of spinning plates that aren’t as high a value as others?”</em>
<em>最近我在同时处理多段关系方面取得了一些成功，但总有一个时刻，我担心一个女孩会发现另一个的存在。我该如何处理这种情况，以避免失去其中任何一个？我是否还应该费心去维持那些价值不如其他的盘子呢？</em></p>
<p>Real options are the cornerstone of confidence, so try not to think of it in terms of risk – as in you’re risking the loss of “a great girl”. Most guys get to a point where Game and plate spinning give them their first taste of real options to select from or fall back on when another doesn’t pan out. The problem arises when they spin enough plates successfully to the point where they think they’ve maxed out to their “best” option and the old scarcity mentality returns. Most times a guy who newly practices Game and plate spinning never really spins plates per se; he uses it for the first monogamous opportunity that’s been eluding him for so long and calls it quits. He never actualizes and internalizes an abundance mentality.</p>
<p>实物期权是信心的基石，因此尽量不要从风险的角度去思考它——比如你冒着失去“一个好女孩”的风险。大多数男性在游戏和盘旋中达到一定程度时，会首次尝到真正的选择，无论是从中挑选还是作为备选。问题出现在他们成功地旋转足够多的盘子，以至于认为自己已经达到了“最佳”选择，而旧有的稀缺心态再次回归。很多时候，一个新接触游戏和盘旋的男性实际上并没有真正旋转盘子；他只是利用它来抓住那个长期逃避他的第一次一夫一妻制机会，然后就放弃了。他从未实现和内化一种丰盛的心态。</p>
<p>Spinning Plates doesn’t necessarily mean you’re fucking all of your plates. It’s more of a spreading out of your efforts across a wider pool of subjects. Some will reciprocate, and those you entertain. Others will not, or prove to be less desirable, and those you let fall. This isn’t as difficult as it sounds once you’ve established your own resolve to be non-exclusive. At some point women will attempt to corner you into exclusivity and this is where your resolve will be tested. Women love to say how they have Rules, well you must have Rules as well. This means not shacking up with a woman, not slipping into any routine with her, not calling her more than necessary to set up another sporadic date, saving your weekends for women who’ve had a proven IL in you (i.e. sex or intimacy) and relegating those who haven’t to Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays, etc. This may seem like a lot of micromanagement, but once you put it into practice in as pragmatic a way possible to accomodate your life you’ll find that the decisions you make regarding the plates you are choosing to spin will become automatic.</p>
<p>旋转盘子并不一定意味着你与所有盘子都有性关系。它更多的是指将你的精力分散到更广泛的群体中。有些会回应，那些你便与之交往；另一些则不会，或显得不那么吸引人，那些你便任其落下。一旦你确立了自己非独占的决心，这并不像听起来那么难。在某些时候，女性会试图将你逼入独占关系，这时你的决心将受到考验。女性喜欢说她们有规则，那么你也要有自己的规则。这意味着不与女性同居，不与她陷入任何常规，不必要时不要频繁打电话给她以安排另一次随机的约会，将周末留给那些已证明与你有过亲密接触（如性或亲密关系）的女性，而将那些没有的女性安排在周二和周三等。这可能看起来像是大量的微观管理，但一旦你以尽可能务实的方式将其融入你的生活，你会发现关于选择旋转哪些盘子的决定将变得自动化。</p>
<p>If you feel that you have something to lose with a particular girl, you’re no longer spinning plates – you’re thinking and approaching dating in terms of exclusivity. POOK’s great quote: “women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled by a faithful loser” A lot of guys (and almost every woman) have a big problem with the truth of this because they take it too literally. POOK was never suggesting that you overtly declare that you’ll be open to other options and that your girls should consciously be expected to accept this. Every woman takes this quote in this way, and with good reason because they don’t want to seem like an easy mark. When it’s on the table like that it unsurprisingly becomes an affront to their pride and self-worth. However, in practice, non-exclusivity has to be covert. It needs to be implied, not declared. Thus you see the truth in POOK’s observation – women’s behavior will bear him out. Imagination and competition anxiety paired with implied non-exclusivity are the tools for successful plate spinning.</p>
<p>如果你觉得与某个女孩有所得失，那么你已不再是单纯地旋转盘子——你是在以排他性的思维来思考和接近约会。POOK 有句名言：“女性宁愿分享一个高价值的男人，也不愿被一个忠诚的失败者束缚。”许多男性（以及几乎所有女性）对此真理感到困扰，因为他们过于字面理解。POOK 从未建议你公开宣称自己会开放选择，并期望你的女孩们自觉接受这一点。每位女性都这样解读这句话，这有其合理性，因为她们不想显得容易被利用。当这种观点被摆上台面时，它自然会冒犯到她们的骄傲和自我价值感。然而，在实践中，非排他性必须是隐秘的。它需要被暗示，而非声明。因此，你看到了 POOK 观察的真实性——女性的行为将证实他的观点。想象力和竞争焦虑加上暗示的非排他性，是成功旋转盘子的工具。</p>
<p><strong>Become the commodity she’s looking for.</strong>
<strong>成为她所寻找的商品。</strong></p>
<p>A high value Man can spin plates, and sometimes those plates suspect there are, or know there are other plates in his rotation. They’ll tolerate it so long as he remains high enough value (or effectively presents that perception) or hypergamy wil move them along to another high value Man. As I state in Plate Theory, some plates fall off to be replaced by new plates. You must be willing and confident enough to let some of them fall. This is a tough reality for recovering chumps new to Game to accept. Deprivation has conditioned them to hang onto a “sure thing” and this becomes all the more difficult when the plate they happen to drop was the first woman they’d ever successfully applied Game to, or was hotter than any girl they’d previously been with.</p>
<p>一个高价值的男人能够同时应对多个女性，有时这些女性会怀疑或知道他还有其他交往对象。只要他保持足够高的价值（或有效地呈现这种认知），她们就会容忍这种情况，否则她们会通过择偶升级转向另一个高价值的男人。正如我在“盘子理论”中提到的，有些盘子会掉落，被新的盘子取代。你必须愿意并且有信心让其中一些掉落。对于刚接触游戏并试图摆脱失败者心态的人来说，接受这一现实是艰难的。长期的匮乏感使他们习惯于抓住“确定的事物”，当他们不小心放手的盘子是他们第一个成功运用游戏策略的女性，或是比以往任何交往过的女孩都更迷人时，这种困难尤为明显。</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, you don’t have to be sexual with every one of the plates you’re spinning (this used to be called “dating” in the days before serial monogamy became the fashion). It’s the potential in knowing that you could be, or that there are women who will value your attention that prompts a competitive anxiety in women – often when you don’t even know you’re doing it. If you are sexual with some of the plates you’re spinning, so much the better since you know that they’re proven commodities and if one isn’t performing as you’d like, you have the unconscious knowledge that others will, or you have the proven ability to generate more options for yourself.</p>
<p>正如我先前所述，你不必与每一个正在交往的女性发生性关系（这在连续一夫一妻制成为潮流之前被称为“约会”）。正是这种知晓自己可能与她们发生关系，或是知道有些女性会珍视你关注的潜在可能性，激发了女性的竞争焦虑——往往在你甚至未察觉自己在这样做时。如果你与其中一些女性发生了性关系，那就更好了，因为你已确认她们是可靠的，如果某一个不如你所愿，你潜意识里知道其他人会，或者你有能力为自己创造更多选择。</p>
<p><strong>Monogamy is a byproduct, not a goal.</strong>
<strong>一夫一妻制是副产品，而非目标。</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles guys have with Plate Theory is breaking themselves of this ‘LTR-as-Goal’ mentality. Obviously I’m not anti-monogamy, however monogamy should never be a goal, it should be a by-product of Plate Theory, but only when you’ve properly filtered through enough plates to understand how options play into confidence and controlling the frame. If a woman is unwilling to be non-exclusive with you (i.e. “she’ll leave me if I see other girls” fear) she isn’t a plate to spin. This seems counterintuitive to a guy with an LTR-As-Goal mentality and it is, but the guy who can fearlessly, and honestly stay above-board with his intent is the one who’ll be spinning more plates. Most guys (AFCs in particular) are deathly afraid of losing that ONE perfect girl and so never even attempt to spin more than one plate, much less have any others to compare her ‘perfection’ to in the first place. I’ve even seen PUAs do exactly this. They’re so impressed with the success of newly perfected techniques that they settle for the ONE ‘dream girl’ and find that their attentions become valueless to her because she perceives she is his only option for intimacy, his script gets flipped on him, and he gets marginalized. It’s not a failure in technique, but rather a failure in his mindset.</p>
<p>男性在理解“板块理论”时面临的最大障碍之一，是摆脱“以长期关系为目标”的心态。显然，我并不反对一夫一妻制，但一夫一妻制绝不应成为目标，而应是“板块理论”的副产品，前提是你已充分筛选过足够多的“板块”，从而理解选择如何影响自信和掌控局面。如果一个女性不愿与你保持非独占关系（即“如果我与其他女孩交往，她会离开我”的恐惧），那么她就不应被视为一个可旋转的“板块”。这看似与“以长期关系为目标”的思维相悖，确实如此，但那些能无畏且坦诚地表明自己意图的男性，才是能旋转更多“板块”的人。大多数男性（尤其是 AFC 们）极其害怕失去那唯一完美的女孩，因此从未尝试过同时旋转多个“板块”，更不用说有其他“板块”来比较她的“完美”了。我甚至见过 PUA 们也这么做。 他们对新近完善的技术所取得的成功印象深刻，以至于满足于仅拥有一位“梦中情人”，却发现他们对她的关注变得毫无价值，因为她意识到自己是他亲密关系的唯一选择，他的剧本被翻转，而他则被边缘化。这并非技术上的失败，而是他心态上的失败。</p>
<p>So what do you do to establish your plates and be truly, and successfully, non-exclusive with women? Initially I’d suggest doing exactly what most women have perfected for the better part of their lifetimes, stay intentionally ambiguous. Women practice Plate Theory by default – they play the Coquette (hard to get), they know how to be ambiguous enough to keep their options open, but not so much as to let a guy’s interest fail. They naturally know that we only chase what runs away from us. They never commit fully, but still keep the carrot in front of the donkey.</p>
<p>那么，你该如何确立自己的“盘子”，真正且成功地与女性保持非排他性关系呢？首先，我建议你效仿大多数女性在她们大半生中精通的策略：保持有意模糊。女性默认实践“盘子理论”——她们扮演难以捉摸的“娇羞女郎”（难以接近），懂得如何保持足够的模糊性以保持选择开放，但又不会过度以至于让男性的兴趣消退。她们本能地知道，我们只会追逐那些逃避我们的事物。她们从不完全投入，却始终让希望在前方牵引着追求者。</p>
<p>Women communicate COVERTLY, with gesture, with looks, with veiled meanings – you have to communicate your intent to be non-exclusive COVERTLY. Never OVERTLY tell a woman you’ve got other plates than her spinning. Allow her to discover this by your mannerisms, your behaviors, and definitely by your availability to her. Create value through scarcity, don’t be so available to her, but just enough to keep her interest and allow her mind to consider that maybe you have other options. Even when you don’t, fomenting this anxiety is a VERY useful tool for you while you do get more plates to spin. Even the ambient confidence that comes from knowing you have a past, proven, ability to generate more sexual options for yourself will manifest itself in your personality and trigger this competition anxiety.</p>
<p>女性以隐晦的方式交流，通过手势、眼神和含蓄的含义——你必须隐秘地传达出你非独占的意图。绝不要直接告诉一位女性你还有其他选择在旋转。让她通过你的举止、行为，尤其是你对她的可得性来发现这一点。通过稀缺性创造价值，不要对她过于可得，但要恰到好处以保持她的兴趣，并让她心中考虑或许你还有其他选项。即便你并没有，制造这种焦虑在你获取更多选择时是一个极其有用的工具。甚至那种源自知晓自己过去曾证明有能力为自己创造更多性选择的自信，也会在你的个性中显现，并触发这种竞争焦虑。</p>
<p>At some point a woman will resort to OVERT communications when she’s run out of options in her COVERT communications tool set. This is the point the anxiety becomes unbearable and the need for security forces her to be OVERT. This is usually the stage at which she’s ask something like “where is this going?” or “am I your girlfriend?” or she may even give you an ultimatum. See this for what it is, she feels powerless and this is a press to commit. This is the point at which you will end up as a “cheater” or you’ll continue to spin plates. You actually have a lot of options in this situation, in fact more than you will ever have with any individual woman. You can of course take the coward’s path and just agree to exclusivity with her, but in doing so you lose all options (for as far as you’re willing to commit) as she intently becomes your only means of intimacy. She becomes the broker for your sexuality and you lose power, whereas before YOU were in control of your sexual availability.</p>
<p>在某些时候，当一个女人在她的隐性沟通工具箱中用尽所有选项后，她会转向显性沟通。这是焦虑变得难以忍受，对安全感的迫切需求迫使她变得显性的时刻。通常在这个阶段，她会问一些问题，比如“我们这是在往哪儿发展？”或“我是你的女朋友吗？”甚至可能给你一个最后通牒。要明白这是怎么回事，她感到无能为力，这是在逼你做出承诺。在这个节点上，你最终可能成为“骗子”，或者继续同时与多人保持关系。实际上，在这种情况下你有很多选择，事实上比与任何单一女性相处时都多。当然，你可以选择懦夫的路径，仅仅同意与她独占关系，但这样做你会失去所有其他选项（只要你愿意承诺的程度），因为她将专注成为你唯一的亲密途径。她成为你性行为的经纪人，你失去了权力，而之前是你控制着自己的性可得性。</p>
<p>You could continue to spin her as well, but bear in mind she’s resorted to OVERTLY confronting you about it and it wont be the last you hear of it. Depending on how long you’ve had her around, you may simply just let her drop. You might also keep her going, but let her cool a bit and come back to her in a few week’s time. Again, this seems counterintuitive, but your attention will either wildly increase in her value of it or she’ll simply bug out in which case it wasn’t worth pursuing and you aren’t wasting your time and effort on a woman with less than 100% IL.</p>
<p>你也可以继续与她周旋，但请记住，她已公然向你提出质疑，这不会是你最后一次听到此事。根据她在你身边的时间长短，你或许可以直接让她离开。你也可能选择继续维持关系，但先让她冷静一段时间，几周后再重新接触。这看似有违直觉，但你的关注要么会极大地提升她对此的重视，要么她会直接放弃，那样的话就不值得追求，你也不会在一个连 100%投入都没有的女人身上浪费时间和精力。</p>
<p><strong>Confidence is derived from options.</strong>
<strong>信心源自选择。</strong></p>
<p>Don’t think of plate theory as a filter so much as it is a means to reinforce confidence. If you were to step into the ring with a professional UFC fighter right now it’d probably be suicide for you. But train for a few years, spar with other fighters and win a few bouts and you’ll probably be confident enough in your past performances that you know you can hold your own in the ring. That’s the idea, confidence derived from the options of non-exclusive women in hand and from having successfully generated those options in the past.</p>
<p>不要将板块理论视为过滤器，而应将其视为增强自信的手段。假设你现在步入八角笼与一位职业 UFC 选手对决，那对你来说无异于自寻死路。但若经过几年的训练，与他人实战切磋并赢得几场比赛，你很可能就会因过往的表现而信心满满，深知自己能在笼中一展身手。这就是板块理论的精髓所在：自信源自手中握有的非排他性女性选择权，以及过去成功创造这些选择权的经历。</p>
<p>It’s not a numbers game, it’s a non-exclusivity game. The goal isn’t racking up as many women as humanly possible in order to sift through the throng and find that one little golden flower. In fact that’s the key to disaster. There is no Quality Woman, that’s an idealization. Some are better than others of course, but you don’t find the perfect woman, you make the perfect woman. There is no needle in the haystack – that is Scarcity / ONEitis thinking – the point is to mold yourself and any woman who you do exclusively end up with into your own frame. This is a process that should come before you commit to exclusivity, not after. The world is filled with guys forever trying to catch up, control the frame and be the Man they should’ve been long before they entered an LTR. They spend the better part of their LTRs/Marriages trying to prove that they deserve their GF’s / Wife’s respect when they’d have done better in letting her come to that conclusion well before the commitment through a healthy dose of competition anxiety.</p>
<p>这不是数字游戏，而是非排他性游戏。目标并非竭尽所能地积累尽可能多的女性，以便从人群中筛选出那一朵小小的金花。事实上，那正是灾难的根源。并不存在所谓的优质女性，那只是一种理想化。当然，有些女性优于其他，但你不会找到完美的女人，而是要塑造出完美的女人。没有藏在稻草堆里的针——那是稀缺/唯一症思维——关键在于塑造你自己以及你最终独占的任何女性，使之符合你的框架。这一过程应在承诺独占之前进行，而非之后。世界上充斥着那些永远试图追赶、掌控框架并成为他们本应在进入长期关系前就成为的男人。他们将大部分时间花在长期关系/婚姻中，试图证明自己配得上女友/妻子的尊重，而更好的做法是通过适度的竞争焦虑，让她在承诺之前就得出这个结论。</p>

嗨，罗洛，我叫阿卡什，是你文章的忠实粉丝。它们总是清晰、有逻辑且富有洞见。

I discovered the community about 5 months ago after yet another failed relationship characterized by highly AFC behavior on my part. I ended it with a tremendous amount of guilt as I felt that because she was a “good person” I ought to have made it work even though I wasn’t in love with her. I am 27 years old.
大约 5 个月前，在又一次因我极度缺乏恋爱技巧而导致的关系失败后，我发现了这个社区。我带着巨大的内疚感结束了这段关系，因为我感到，既然她是个“好人”，我就应该努力维持，尽管我对她没有爱情。我今年 27 岁。

Based on your posts I would really appreciate your advice on two issues:
根据您的帖子，我非常希望能得到您对两个问题的建议：
(1) how to make the best use of my impending return to school in May for a second undergraduate degree and;
(1) 如何充分利用我即将在五月重返校园攻读第二个本科学位的时机；
(2) how to overcome the cognitive dissonance I feel about pursuing women outside the confines of a committed relationship as I still suffer from social conditioning that tells me I will hurt women by pursuing primarily sexual relationships with them and so it is immoral to do so.
(2) 如何克服我在追求非承诺关系之外的女性时所感受到的认知失调，因为我仍受到社会条件的制约，认为我主要追求与她们的性关系会伤害女性，因此这样做是不道德的。

If you would like to post a reply on the forum, rather than by a PM, for the benefit of others that is fine with me. I wanted to direct these queries to you though as I believe I could benefit from your worldy wise opinion.
如果您愿意在论坛上发表回复，而不是通过私信，以便让其他人受益，我对此没有意见。不过，我想直接向您提出这些问题，因为我相信我能从您丰富的人生智慧中获益。

Sincerely look forward to hearing from you.

<p>Akash, 阿卡什，</p>
<p>I’ll give you a run down of what I can gather from your initial post, but understand that what you’ve given me here is pretty limited as far as information is concerned. I can only assume certain things from the very brief description of your life so take what I write with that in mind. In the future give me a better account of what your AFC behaviors were, how your relationships have ended, family background, where you live, why you’re pursuing a second degree, etc. I can be more accurate and avoid assumptions this way.</p>
<p>我会根据你的初始帖子，概述我能收集到的信息，但请理解，你所提供的内容在信息方面相当有限。我只能从你简短的生活描述中做出某些假设，因此请带着这个前提阅读我的文字。未来，请更详细地描述你的 AFC 行为、恋爱关系如何结束、家庭背景、居住地、追求第二学位的原因等。这样我能更准确，并避免做出假设。</p>
<p>To begin with, you’ve only been involved in the “community” for the past 5 months so the first thing I’m going to tell you is that it takes time to mold your personality and unlearn mental schemas you’ve become conditioned to consider integral parts of your current personality. One of the biggest obstacles most men have with accepting the fundaments of a positive masculine mindset is the attitude that personality is static and uncontrollable by them. A lot of this “that’s just how I am” mentality comes from this basic conditioning and needs to be addressed from the outset since this almost universally is an ego-investment on the part of a guy who’s probably emotionally distressed, confused and/or frustrated.</p>
<p>首先，你仅在过去 5 个月中参与了“社区”，因此我要告诉你的第一件事是，塑造你的个性并摒弃那些你已习惯视为当前个性不可或缺部分的思维模式需要时间。大多数男性在接受积极男性心态的基本原则时遇到的最大障碍之一，就是认为个性是静态的，且不受他们控制。这种“我就是这样的”心态很大程度上源于这种基本条件反射，需要从一开始就加以解决，因为这几乎普遍是那些可能情感困扰、困惑和/或沮丧的男性在自我投资上的表现。</p>
<p>Understand now that personality is ultimately what YOU determine it to be. This isn’t to say that external factors don’t influence personality; indeed these variables and outside influences are exactly the reason men such as yourself do seek out the community. However, it is you who determine what is comfortable for you and what will constitute the traits that makes your personality your own. You are most definitely not a blank slate, but you have the capacity to erase parts you don’t like or are unusable and rewrite new parts that you like and prove efficient.</p>
<p>现在明白，个性最终是由你自己决定的。这并不是说外部因素不会影响个性；事实上，这些变量和外部影响正是像你这样的人寻求社群的原因。然而，是你决定什么对你来说是舒适的，以及哪些特质构成了你个性的独特之处。你绝非一张白纸，但你拥有擦除不喜欢或无用的部分，并重写新部分的能力，这些新部分你喜欢且证明有效。</p>
<p><strong>(1) how to make the best use of my impending return to school in May for a second undergraduate degree</strong>
(1) 如何充分利用我即将在五月开始的第二个本科学位的返校学习</p>
<p>This all depends on what your own personal goals are. The best use you can make of this time is to devote yourself completely to achieving the purpose for which you decided to pursue a second degree in the first place. I can only assume you are working for this degree with a set outcome in mind, but is this what you truly want? I ask this because I know far too many men who’ve altered the course of their lives to better accommodate the women in their lives or to facilitate their insecurities and fear of rejection. It’s not an unfamiliar story to me to hear of how a guy opted for a certain university or a career path because he’d convinced himself that it would sustain a relationship that he was fearful of loosing or he felt was his “responsibility as a man” to be supportive of her ambitions at the sacrifice of his own. The conclusion of this scenario, more often than not, ends with a bitter man, mad at himself with the long term results of his choices after the woman he’d strived so long to accommodate leaves him for another man who held fast to his own identity and ambition – which is exactly what makes him attractive.</p>
<p>这一切都取决于你个人的目标是什么。你在这段时间内能做的最佳利用，就是全身心投入到实现你最初决定攻读第二学位所追求的目标上。我只能假设你为了这个学位设定了明确的结果，但这是你真正想要的吗？我这样问是因为我见过太多男性为了更好地适应生活中的女性，或是为了缓解自己的不安全感与对拒绝的恐惧，而改变了自己的人生轨迹。对我来说，听到某人选择某所大学或职业道路，因为他自认为这能维系一段他害怕失去的关系，或是他觉得作为男人有责任支持她的抱负，而牺牲了自己的，并不陌生。这种情景的结局往往是一个苦涩的男人，对自己长期选择的结果感到愤怒，尤其是当他曾努力迎合的女人最终离开他，投入一个坚守自我与抱负的男人的怀抱时——而这恰恰是那个男人吸引她的原因。</p>
<p>I’m not sure how or if this fits into your conditions, but let it serve as an illustration for reclaiming and remolding your own personality. Only you have the hindsight to assess why you made certain decisions in your life. I’m only asking you to be as brutally critical of your true motivations for making them. Maybe it’s time you review why you decided to pursue a second degree?</p>
<p>我不确定这如何或是否符合您的条件，但愿它能为重塑您个人特质提供一个例证。唯有您能凭借后见之明，评判自己一生中某些决策的缘由。我仅是恳请您，对这些决策背后的真实动机进行毫不留情的自我审视。或许，现在是时候回顾一下，当初为何决定攻读第二个学位了？</p>
<p><strong>(2) how to overcome the cognitive dissonance I feel about pursuing women outside the confines of a committed relationship as I still suffer from social conditioning that tells me I will hurt women by pursuing primarily sexual relationships with them and so it is immoral to do so.</strong>
(2) 如何克服我在追求非承诺关系之外的女性时所感受到的认知失调，因为我仍受到社会条件的制约，认为我主要追求与她们的性关系会伤害女性，因此这样做是不道德的。
Akash, any reasonably attractive woman knows you’d like to have sex with her. It’s a primal, chemical instinct and to be bluntly honest, there’s nothing wrong with it. In certain Muslim sects men are allowed to take “temporary” wives for a set period of time in addition to their “permanent” wives so long as they support them financially. Some Mormons practice open polygamy in a similar fashion. Some men marry and divorce multiple times (and support them congruously). All of these practices are considered, to a greater or lesser degree, moral. The dissonance occurs when the rationalizations for a behavior conflict with the motivations for it and the associative psycho-social stigmas that get attached to it. Sorry for the $10 words here, but your feelings of guilt or hesitancy in a desire to explore multiple relationships is a calculated result of a very effective social conditioning with a latent purpose meant to curb a natural impulse.
阿卡什，任何相貌尚可的女性都知道你想与她发生性关系。这是一种原始的、化学性的本能，坦率地说，这并无不妥。在某些穆斯林教派中，男性除了“永久”妻子外，还可以拥有“临时”妻子一段时间，只要他们能经济支持她们。一些摩门教徒以类似方式实行开放的多妻制。有些男性多次结婚又离婚（并相应地提供经济支持）。这些做法在不同程度上都被视为道德的。当行为的合理化与动机相冲突，以及与之相关的社会心理污名附着其上时，就会产生不协调。这里用了些高级词汇，但你对探索多重关系感到的内疚或犹豫，是社会有效条件作用的结果，其潜在目的在于抑制一种自然冲动。</p>
<p>Recognizing this is the first step to progressing beyond it and actually using it (responsibly) to your own advantage. As men, our biological impetus is to have unlimited access to unlimited sexuality with females bearing the best physical attributes. This is a rudimentary fact and on some level of consciousness both men and women understand this. No amount of proselytizing or social conditioning will erase what God and evolution hard-coded into our collective bio-psychological desires and behaviors. Admittedly, social conventions have historically made a good run at limiting this drive, but it can never (nor should it ever) purge this, because in essence it is a survival-ensuring attribute for us.</p>
<p>认识到这一点是超越并实际利用它（负责任地）为自己谋利的第一步。作为男性，我们的生物本能驱使我们渴望无限制地接触拥有最佳身体特征的女性。这是一个基本事实，在某种意识层面上，男性和女性都理解这一点。无论多少布道或社会教化都无法抹去上帝和进化在我们集体的生物心理欲望和行为中植入的印记。诚然，社会规范历来在限制这一冲动方面表现出色，但它永远无法（也不应）根除这一点，因为本质上，这是确保我们生存的特质。</p>
<p>I wont argue against the utility in the latent purpose of absolute monogamy. No other method proves more valuable in parental investment and developing a strong masculine and feminine psyche in a person than that of a committed, opposite sex, two-parent family. I feel it’s necessary to add here that I am thoroughly unconvinced that gender identity is exclusively a set of learned behaviors as many in the mainstream would try to convince us of. There is simply too much biological evidence and the resulting psychological/behavioral response to gender differences to accept this, making it vitally important that a child (and later a healthy adult) be taught a healthy appreciation for both the masculine and feminine influences in their psyches.</p>
<p>我不会反对绝对一夫一妻制潜在目的中的实用性。没有其他方法比承诺的、异性、双亲家庭更能证明在父母投资和培养一个人强大的男性与女性心理方面更有价值。在此，我觉得有必要补充一点，我完全不相信性别认同仅仅是主流观点中许多人试图让我们相信的一套习得行为。生物学上的证据实在太多，以及由此产生的心理/行为对性别差异的反应，使得接受这一点变得至关重要，即必须教导孩子（以及后来的健康成年人）对心理中男性和女性影响都持有健康的欣赏态度。</p>
<p>The genders were meant to be complimentary, not adversarial. I certainly would never condone infidelity based on just this principle alone since it seems the most beneficial for healthy adults. It’s when this healthy monogamy becomes clouded by infantile, emotionality and insecure romanticisms with the resulting expectations that are derived by them that it becomes necessary for a man to cultivate an attitude of being the PRIZE. Adopting this mindset broadens his selection of opportunities for monogamy to his greatest advantage prior to committing to monogamy. In other words, if you are essentially sacrificing your capacity to pursue your biological imperative (unlimited access to unlimited sexuality), pragmatically, you’ll want to choose a partner of the highest quality from the broadest pool of potential you are capable of attracting.</p>
<p>性别本应是互补的，而非对立的。我当然不会仅基于这一原则就赞同不忠行为，因为它似乎最有利于健康成年人。然而，当这种健康的单一伴侣关系被幼稚的情绪化、缺乏安全感的浪漫主义及其衍生出的期望所蒙蔽时，一个男人就有必要培养一种“自己是奖品”的态度。采纳这种心态能让他最大限度地扩大选择范围，从而在承诺单一伴侣关系之前获得最大优势。换句话说，如果你实际上是在牺牲追求生物本能（无限接近无限性行为）的能力，那么从实际出发，你会希望从你能吸引到的最广泛的潜在伴侣中，选择一个质量最高的伴侣。</p>
<p>The downside of this proposition is twofold. First, your ability to attract a sizable pool of quality ‘applicants’ is limited by factors you immediately have available. At 37, if all goes well, you’ll be more financially stable and mature than you are at 27. The 37 year old Akash will, in theory, be more attractive to a long term prospect than the 27 year old Akash. Secondly, women’s sexual value decreases as they age, meaning there is no guarantee that your beautiful, vivacious, 27 year old bride will remain so at 37. In fact the odds are she wont.</p>
<p>这一提议的弊端是双重的。首先，你吸引大量优质“申请者”的能力受限于你当前可利用的因素。在 37 岁时，如果一切顺利，你的财务状况将更加稳定，心智也更为成熟，相较于 27 岁的你，理论上对长期伴侣的吸引力会更大。其次，女性的性价值随着年龄增长而下降，这意味着无法保证你那美丽活泼的 27 岁新娘到了 37 岁依然保持同样的魅力。事实上，她很可能不会。</p>
<p>All of this makes betting your biological imperative on monogamy critically important and thus deserving of the widest possible selection.</p>
<p>这一切使得将你的生物本能押注于一夫一妻制变得至关重要，因此值得拥有最广泛的选择。</p>
<p><strong>Men literally live and die according to their options, so it stands to reason they ought to entertain a prolonged period in their lives where they are open to exploring the most options they have access to while concurrently developing and improving themselves prior to making a commitment of this magnitude.</strong></p>
<p><strong>男人们实际上是根据他们的选择而生与死，因此，他们理应在生活中留出一段较长的时期，在这段时间里，他们可以敞开心扉，探索尽可能多的选择，同时在此之前不断提升和完善自己，以便做出如此重大的承诺。</strong></p>
<p>And this is precisely where most men fail. They buy into and internalize psychological social contrivances (i.e. ONEitis) that are little more than effective means of inculcating a self-expectation of accountability and liability to make this commitment, irrespective of maturity level or personal success (not simply financial success). The saddest ones, the AFC ones are the pitiable men who carry these contrivances into marriage and even old age without ever understanding that they had more potential which they squandered due to an inability to see past these contrivances and learn to be selective based on experience.</p>
<p>而这正是大多数男性失败的地方。他们接受并内化了心理社会机制（如“唯一症”），这些机制不过是有效手段，用以灌输一种自我期望的责任感和义务感，促使他们做出承诺，而不考虑成熟度或个人成就（不仅仅是财务上的成功）。最可悲的是那些 AFC（平均挫男），他们是可怜的男人，将这些机制带入婚姻甚至老年，却从未意识到自己本有更大的潜力，却因无法看透这些机制并基于经验学会选择而白白浪费。</p>
<p>A truly powerful Man jealously guards his most precious resources; his independence and his ability to maneuver. In other words his options and his ability to exercise them. True power isn’t controlling others, but the degree to which you control the course of your own life and your own choices. Commitment to anything ALWAYS limits this. When you step through one door, a hundred more close behind you. You’re free to do what you want, right? You can always quit a job, divorce a wife, change your school, etc., but how many men do you know who are what they are today as a result of their own real doing, unfettered by how their choices impact their GF, wife, kids, parents, etc.? By comparison, how many guys do you know who dutifully stick with a dead-end job that’s slowly killing them because it’s better than dealing with the consequences and backlash it would have on his family? Are they free to quit? Sure, but not without an impact on their families and relationships.</p>
<p>一个真正强大的人会小心翼翼地守护他最宝贵的资源：他的独立性和应变能力。换言之，是他选择的余地以及行使这些选择的能力。真正的力量并非控制他人，而是你能在多大程度上掌控自己生活的轨迹和选择。对任何事物的承诺总是会限制这一点。当你推开一扇门，身后可能关闭了上百扇。你可以自由地做你想做的事，对吧？你总能辞去工作、离婚、转学等等，但你知道有多少人今天之所以是他们自己，是因为他们真正自主的选择，不受其选择对女友、妻子、孩子、父母等的影响所束缚？相比之下，你又认识多少男人，他们忠实地坚守着一份慢慢扼杀他们的死胡同工作，只因这比面对其对家庭带来的后果和反弹要好？他们能自由辞职吗？当然可以，但这样做会对家庭和关系产生影响。</p>
<p>So where does this leave you? You have 2 paths as I see it. You can sarge and explore your options with multiple LTRs and, should you decide to become sexually involved, do so while maintaining non-exclusivity with them. Put off and unlearn the expectations you’ve been conditioned to accept through (feminine beneficent) social contrivances and truly explore your opportunities while bettering your own conditions in anticipation for becoming monogamous at some later point. Or, you can remain in your sense of moral doctrine (no shame in this) and still non-exclusively date and explore your options while you continue to better yourself with the caveat that you know you’ll be limiting your depth of experience. I wont denigrate a decision to opt for this, but far too few religious men have the perseverance to stay objective in their decision to ‘hold out’ and overlook major character flaws in women they’d like to be their spouse in a furious rush to marry them and get to “the sex part.” Better to fall short in conviction than make hurried decisions that will alter your life.</p>
<p>那么，这对你意味着什么呢？在我看来，你有两条路可走。你可以尝试与多人建立长期关系并探索各种可能性，若决定发展性关系，则保持非独占性。摆脱并摒弃那些通过（女性恩惠型）社会机制灌输给你的期望，真正探索机会的同时，改善自身条件，为将来某个时刻步入一夫一妻制做好准备。或者，你可以坚守自己的道德准则（这无可厚非），在不独占的前提下继续约会并探索选项，同时不断提升自我，但需意识到这将限制你经验的深度。我不会贬低选择这条路的人，但遗憾的是，太多虔诚的男性缺乏坚持客观判断的毅力，他们在决定“坚守”时，往往忽视了心仪女性身上的重大性格缺陷，急于结婚并迅速进入“性”阶段。与其信念不坚，不如避免仓促决策，以免影响一生。</p>
<p>And perhaps this isn’t even what you’re driving at? I don’t know if it’s a religious conviction or an internalized social contrivance that passes for one that’s the cause of your hesitancy, but isn’t it interesting that both are so closely associated? I know devout atheists who still believe in the fallacy of the ONE or the soulmate myth. Most women (and far too many men) look at me as if I’d denied the existence of God when I elaborate on why I think their eHarmony, induced fantasy of a soulmate is hogwash and psychologically damaging on a social scale.</p>
<p>或许这甚至不是你想要表达的？我不确定是宗教信仰还是内化的社会观念，这种被当作信仰的东西，是导致你犹豫不决的原因，但这两者如此紧密相关，难道不有趣吗？我认识虔诚的无神论者，他们仍然相信“唯一”的谬论或灵魂伴侣的神话。大多数女性（以及太多男性）在听我详细阐述为何我认为他们由 eHarmony 引发的灵魂伴侣幻想是胡说八道且在社会层面上具有心理伤害时，看我的眼神仿佛我否认了上帝的存在。</p>
<p>Regardless, whatever your reasons, women should only ever be a compliment to a man’s life, never the focus of it. When you start living for a woman you become that woman. Never again compromise your own identity to receive the ever-changing approval she grants you. You have to be the PRIZE at all times, not just while you’re single. In fact, it’s imperative that you remain so into an LTR. My suggestion to you is not to even entertain the idea of monogamy until you are established in your career for 2 years, after your college is complete. Play the field, do whatever, but do not commit even to a girlfriend. Rather make a commitment to yourself, promise yourself you wont allow yourself to let emotionality and conditioned expectations of monogamy dictate what your goals will be or how you’ll achieve them.</p>
<p>无论如何，无论出于何种原因，女性应始终只是男性生活中的点缀，而非焦点。当你开始为某个女人而活，你便成了那个女人。永远不要为了获得她那不断变化的认可而牺牲自己的身份。你必须始终是那个奖品，而不仅仅是在单身时。事实上，在长期关系中保持这一点至关重要。我的建议是，在你大学毕业后至少在职业生涯中稳定两年之前，不要考虑一夫一妻制。尽情享受单身生活，做任何你想做的事，但不要对任何女友做出承诺。相反，向自己承诺，保证不会让情感和一夫一妻制的固有期待左右你的目标或实现目标的方式。</p>
<p>It’s called enlightened self-interest; you cannot help anyone until you’ve first helped yourself.</p>
<p>这被称为开明的利己主义；在你帮助别人之前，首先得帮助自己。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="plate-theory-iv-goal-state-monogamy"><a class="header" href="#plate-theory-iv-goal-state-monogamy">Plate Theory IV: Goal-State Monogamy</a></h1>
<p>Whenever a guy uninitiated to the concept of spinning plates reads the theory for the first time his first response is usually rejection of it because it conflicts with their monogamy-as-goal mindset. Understand, this is always going to be a tough stretch for any AFC of course, but also the ‘natural’ guy who doesn’t have much trouble attracting women. Monogamy-as-a-goal is a feminine imperative social contrivance, but it also has roots in our natural desire for security, so it makes anything even remotely like plate spinning counterintuitive. The feminine imperative pounds into men’s collective consciousnesses over the course of a lifetime that monogamy will cure loneliness, make them responsible, provide them with a constant supply of sex, and a host of other things that assures them it’s “the right thing to do” and in their own best interest. This then leads the more option-less individuals to develop and practice AFC methods and rationales in accordance with what they believe (and have been told by) women is required of them in order to achieve their monogamous intimacy.</p>
<p>每当一个未接触过“旋转盘子”概念的男性初次阅读这一理论时，他的第一反应通常是拒绝，因为它与他们以一夫一妻制为目标的心态相冲突。理解这一点，对于任何 AFC（平均水平男性）来说，这总是一个艰难的跨越，对于那些自然吸引女性并无太大困难的“天生”男性也是如此。以一夫一妻制为目标是一种女性主导的社会构造，但它也植根于我们对安全感的自然渴望，因此，任何与旋转盘子稍有相似的行为都显得反直觉。女性主导的观念一生都在不断灌输给男性的集体意识，即一夫一妻制能治愈孤独，使他们负责任，为他们提供持续的性供应，以及其他诸多保证，让他们相信这是“正确的事情”，并符合他们的最佳利益。这导致那些选择较少的人根据他们所相信（以及被女性告知）的，为了实现一夫一妻制的亲密关系，而发展和实践 AFC 的方法和理由。</p>
<p>So understandably when the principle of being non-exclusive is presented to them in a rational way (in stead of a ridiculed way as it’s normally passed off as) it conflicts with this perceived path to happiness in monogamy. The very idea that any man would be better off with more options in this arena of life, or could feasibly and logistically pull it off seems foreign. As a counter to this he makes up rationales as to why it wont work or wont work for him.</p>
<p>因此，当以理性方式（而非通常被嘲笑的方式）向他们提出非排他性原则时，这与他们所认为的通向一夫一妻制幸福的路径产生了冲突。任何男人在这个生活领域中拥有更多选择会更好，或者在实际操作和逻辑上能够实现这一点的想法，似乎都显得陌生。作为对此的反驳，他会编造出一些理由，解释为什么这行不通，或者对他来说行不通。</p>
<h2 id="logistics-物流"><a class="header" href="#logistics-物流">Logistics 物流</a></h2>
<p><em>“I can’t spin plates because I have too little time, I can’t manage more than one without the other finding out, etc.”</em>
<em>“我无法同时处理多件事，因为时间太少，我无法同时管理多个事务而不让其他事情察觉到，等等。”</em></p>
<p>If you are indeed spinning plates in a healthy, upfront, non-exclusive way this should never be an issue. There are Game-aware Men with less time than most who manage 4-5 different girls in a week without having them consume all their leisure and business time. I don’t suggest that you go this route per se, because for the better part PUAs rely on a dishonesty in non-exclusivity. However, the reason they are capable of this is because they’ve perfected plate spinning effectively enough to have the plates spin themselves.</p>
<p>如果你确实以健康、坦诚、非独占的方式在转盘子，这应该永远不会成为问题。有些时间比大多数人少的游戏意识强的男性，一周内能管理 4-5 个不同的女孩，而不让她们占用全部的休闲和商务时间。我并不建议你走这条路，因为大多数 PUA 依赖于非独占性中的不诚实。然而，他们能做到这一点的原因是，他们已经将转盘子技巧磨练得足够好，以至于盘子能自行旋转。</p>
<p>Most uninitiated AFCs reason that they MUST, at all costs, apply a constant effort to each and every girl they encounter at risk of losing a “good one.” Besides this being indicative of ‘soul-mate thinking’, what they fear is losing a plate because they are unaccustomed to having the leisure to do so. This is evidence of a scarcity mentality that is a result of their monogamy-as-goal preconditioning. Plate Theory necessitates an attitude of fearlessness – not carelessness, fearlessness. When you’re practicing Plate Theory your plates should call you. You are the PRIZE and the Prince who’s time is valuable and sought after. You should be the object of women’s pursuit. That said, you still have to make an effort to see them and keep the attention you do apply to them valuable, but this must be done with the attitude that if one plate falls you’re confident in your other options or your ability to generate new options.</p>
<p>大多数未入门的 AFC（平均挫男）认为，他们必须不惜一切代价，对遇到的每一位女性都持续付出努力，以免错失“好女孩”。这不仅表明了他们“灵魂伴侣”的思维模式，他们还担心失去一个盘子，因为他们不习惯有闲暇去这样做。这是由于他们将一夫一妻制作为目标的预设条件导致的稀缺心态。盘子理论要求一种无畏的态度——不是粗心大意，而是无畏。当你实践盘子理论时，应该是你的盘子主动联系你。你是奖赏，是时间宝贵、备受追捧的王子。你应该成为女性追求的对象。尽管如此，你仍需努力去见她们，并确保你对她们的关注有价值，但这种努力必须建立在你自信于其他选择或创造新选择的能力上，即使一个盘子掉落也不影响大局。</p>
<p><em>Personality Type 人格类型</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m just not like that. I don’t want to be considered a playah. I could never do that to a woman. How can anyone be like that?”</em>
<em>“我就是不像那样。我不想被视为花花公子。我绝不会那样对待一个女人。怎么有人能那样呢？”</em></p>
<p>This rationale is a common one and not limited just to AFCs. There are plenty of otherwise confident, positively masculine men who’d still think they owe it to women to allow them to set the frame of their relationships without any fear of competition anxiety. Players are men who’re dishonest – they are not spinning plates because they are isolating each plate independent of the other, and this goes back to logistics. Of course you can’t find time for anything else if all you do is try to coordinate each individual story with each plate for fear that they discover each other. The plate spinning Man has no need for this, because he NEVER IMPLIES EXCLUSIVITY TO ANY PLATE. Either they accept this or they’re not a plate to consider. Done in a frank, honest, yet indirect above-table way you will not be a ‘Player’ and you will establish yourself as Man who’s attention is worth competing for.</p>
<p>这种逻辑很常见，并非仅限于 AFC（平均水平的男人）。许多原本自信、阳刚气质十足的男人，仍会认为他们应该让女性主导关系框架，无需担心竞争焦虑。所谓“玩家”，指的是那些不诚实的男性——他们并非在同时经营多段关系，而是将每段关系孤立开来，这归根结底是关于资源调配的问题。如果你整天忙于协调每段关系，生怕它们相互揭露，自然无暇顾及其他。而擅长“转盘子”的男人则无需如此，因为他从不向任何一方暗示排他性。要么对方接受这一点，要么就不算作他考虑的“盘子”。以坦诚、直接但又不失礼貌的方式行事，你便不会沦为“玩家”，而会树立起一个值得他人争夺关注的男性形象。</p>
<p>Women would rather share a successful man than be saddled with a faithful loser. This perfectly sums up Plate Theory vs. Monogamy-as-Goal mindsets. Men in general gravely underestimate the power of female competition anxiety and how useful it really is. As I’ve said before, women are natural plate theorists – they are accustomed from a very early age to mitigate multiple sex-interests, they simply learn how to balance their indirect communications with that anxiety in their own plate spinning. Anxiety in women is good for men. Even when they make no effort to use it or would never consider it if they knew it’s usefulness it is ALWAYS present. Everything a woman does on a daily basis is colored by competition anxiety. Make up, clothing, shoes (God, the SHOES!), indirect communications with men and women, social contrivances, comparing and evaluating dates and possible suitors, EVERYTHING is bourn from this competitive desire to achieve security with the best possible guy and make damn sure the girl next door doesn’t get him first. This anxiety is analogous to men’s consummate fear of rejection and all of the myriad rationales he’ll create and the Buffers he’ll devise to avoid it.</p>
<p>女性宁愿分享一个成功的男人，也不愿背负一个忠诚的失败者。这完美地概括了盘论与一夫一妻制目标心态之间的对比。男性普遍严重低估了女性竞争焦虑的力量及其真正效用。正如我之前所说，女性天生就是盘论者——她们从小便习惯于应对多重性兴趣，并学会如何在旋转盘子时平衡自己的间接沟通与这种焦虑。女性的焦虑对男性有益。即便她们无意利用它，或即便知晓其效用也从未考虑过，这种焦虑始终存在。女性日常所做的一切都受到竞争焦虑的影响。化妆、服饰、鞋子（天哪，那些鞋子！）、与男女的间接沟通、社交手段、比较和评估约会对象及潜在追求者，所有这一切都源于这种竞争欲望，即力求与最优秀的男性获得安全感，并确保隔壁女孩不会捷足先登。这种焦虑类似于男性对拒绝的终极恐惧，以及他们为避免拒绝而创造的各种理由和设计的缓冲机制。</p>
<p>Bear in mind that monogamy is a dictate of the feminine imperative. It is the social contract that the feminine ultimately needs in order to quell a constant desire for security in a very chaotic world. When you are predisposed to monogamy-as-goal thinking, or trying to break yourself of this, understand that this is a tool of the feminine imperative. That’s not to discount the overall merits of monogamy, but it is to make you aware of how it’s acculturated into men as a responsibility to providing monogamy. Men who find themselves in a state of internal conflict about abandoning monogamy-as-goal are really confronting a fundamental shift in their prior conditioning.</p>
<p>请记住，一夫一妻制是女性主导原则的指令。这是女性最终需要的社会契约，以便在一个极度混乱的世界中平息对安全感的持续渴望。当你倾向于将一夫一妻制视为目标的思维，或试图摆脱这种思维时，要明白这是女性主导原则的工具。这并不是要否定一夫一妻制的整体优点，而是要让你意识到它如何被文化塑造为男性提供一夫一妻制的责任。那些发现自己内心冲突于放弃一夫一妻制目标的男性，实际上正面临其先前条件作用的基本转变。</p>

<p>I had a good amount of response on last Friday’s Plate Theory post asking for a more complete idea of women being natural Plate Theorists, so I thought I’d elaborate on this.
上周五关于板块理论的帖子收到了不少回应，许多人希望更全面地了解女性作为天然板块理论家的概念，因此我想对此进行详细阐述。</p>
<h2 id="female-plate-theory-女性板块理论"><a class="header" href="#female-plate-theory-女性板块理论">Female Plate Theory 女性板块理论</a></h2>
<p>For as often as I’ve mentioned women being natural plate theorists, I don’t think I’ve ever gone into detail about it. I think it’s pretty well established that I completely disagree with idea that women will only fuck one guy at a time. I could outline several women I know from experience in this, but really, observing behavior will bear this out fairly predictably. I will however agree that they are predisposed to, and are socially encouraged to, seek monogamy, but as in all things female the talk rarely matches the behavior. Sexuality is a woman’s first, best agency and even the homeliest woman know this – even when they’re just complaining about other women using it.
尽管我多次提到女性天生是板块理论家，但我似乎从未详细阐述过这一点。我认为，我完全不同意女性一次只会与一个男性发生关系的观点，这一点已经相当明确。我可以列举几个我亲身经历过的女性例子，但实际上，观察她们的行为就能相当可预测地证实这一点。然而，我同意女性天生倾向于，并且社会鼓励她们追求一夫一妻制，但正如所有女性行为一样，言辞与实际行动往往不符。性是女性最首要、最有效的手段，即便是相貌平平的女性也深知这一点——即使她们只是在抱怨其他女性利用这一点。</p>
<p>The principle that a woman’s first priority is to seek out security is true, and we’d be wise to bear this in mind when evaluating motives for behavior, but their methodology is what’s in question here. There is an understandable confusion for guys in this respect. On one hand women present a constant facade that the fear of being perceived as a slut (i.e. concurrently fucking more than one guy at a time) is primary to their self-respect and respectability. However, this has to be tempered with the desire to experience a variety of men in order to ensure the security/provisioning from the best among them. So in order to facilitate this women must practice a kind of calculated hypocrisy that is socially reinforced by the gender as a whole as well as some men (usually those so optionless as to excuse the behavior in order to get to her sexuality, or guys so conditioned that they overlook it as normal).
女性将寻求安全感视为首要原则是正确的，我们在评估行为动机时明智的做法是牢记这一点，但这里所质疑的是她们的方法。在这方面，男性感到困惑是可以理解的。一方面，女性始终展现出一种表象，即害怕被视为荡妇（即同时与多个男性发生关系）是她们自尊和受人尊敬的首要因素。然而，这种表象必须与体验不同男性的欲望相平衡，以确保从他们中最优秀者那里获得安全感或供养。因此，为了促成这一点，女性必须实践一种经过计算的虚伪，这种虚伪被整个性别群体以及某些男性（通常是那些为了接近她的性而对此行为予以原谅的无可选择者，或是那些已习惯性地视之为常态的男性）所社会化地强化。</p>
<p>It is socially acceptable for a woman to blatantly spin plates.
在社交场合，女性公然表演转盘子是被接受的。</p>
<p>Does this sound outrageous? While a woman who makes her sexual practices a bit too overt runs the risk of being perceived as a slut (which is dubious in this age as it is), most relatively attractive women covertly have a constant bullpen of starters ready to go to bat at any one time – these are also known as ‘Orbiters’. These are the attention providers, the “maybe” guys. And it makes little difference in terms of available options which she chooses at any given time, the very fact that she has five or six of them pursuing her is enough to boost her sense of self-worth, her social status within her same-gender peers, and give her the confidence to drop any one of her plates at a moments notice for any reason knowing that 2 or 3 more guys (or 20 more on facebook) stand ready to take his place, no questions asked and prepared rationalizations at the ready.
这听起来是否有些离谱？尽管一个女性若将她的性行为表现得过于明显，可能会被视为放荡（在这个时代，这一标签本身就颇具争议），但大多数相对有魅力的女性暗中总有一群备胎随时待命，准备出击——这些人也被称为“卫星者”。他们是提供关注的人，是那些“或许”先生。无论她在任何时候选择谁，对她可选择的对象数量影响甚微，她拥有五六个追求者这一事实本身，就足以提升她的自我价值感、在同性朋友圈中的社会地位，并赋予她随时因任何理由放弃某段关系的自信，因为她知道有两三个（或是在 Facebook 上的二十个）男性随时准备接替，无需多问，且已备好合理的解释。</p>
<p>In addition, this practice is socially reinforced by women doing the same thing and the social conventions constructed to excuse the behavior. It’s the unspoken rule of a woman’s prerogative; she can always change her mind. This is a powerful tool for women –  in any situation, if a woman doesn’t choose to be sexual it is necessarily forced (or obligated), even when it’s after the fact. Either the “Jerk” forced her, physically or emotionally, or she had thought she wanted to, but later reconsidered – it makes little difference. In all social situations the default is to side with the feminine, the “weaker sex” – women, from sympathy or empathy, and men, from a desire to eventually become intimate with them. Dalrock expertly describes this convention in his “Don’t hit me, I’m a girl” post.
此外，这种行为通过女性之间的相互强化以及为其开脱的社会习俗而得到社会层面的加强。这是女性特权的不言而喻的规则；她随时可以改变主意。这对女性而言是一种强大的工具——在任何情况下，如果女性不选择性行为，那么这一行为必然是被迫（或义务性的），即便是在事后。无论是“混蛋”对她施加了身体或情感上的强迫，还是她曾以为自己愿意，但后来重新考虑了——这几乎无关紧要。在所有社交场合中，默认立场都是偏向女性，即所谓的“弱势性别”——出于同情或同理心，人们会站在女性一边，而男性则出于最终与她们亲密接触的愿望。Dalrock 在其“别打我，我是女孩”一文中精辟地描述了这一习俗。</p>
<p>In either instance, the feminine prerogative is socially reinforced. That’s important to understand because even by my focusing on it here as a male, my motives for doing so become suspect. That’s how embedded this dynamic is – to question it risks ostracization. However, I also understand that for the greater part of women, this plate spinning dynamic isn’t a conscious effort on their part. In fact I’d suggest that it’s so thoroughly recognized that women default to it autonomously. Also, this is a good example of the first principle of power – when you have power, always feign powerlessness.
在任何情况下，女性的特权都受到社会的强化。这一点至关重要，因为即使我作为一个男性在此关注它，我的动机也会受到质疑。这种动态的根深蒂固程度可见一斑——质疑它可能会招致排斥。然而，我也明白，对大多数女性而言，这种盘旋不定的动态并非她们有意识的努力。实际上，我倾向于认为，这种行为已被女性内化至无需思考便能自主执行的程度。此外，这也是权力第一原则的一个良好例证——当你拥有权力时，永远要假装无力。</p>
<h2 id="free-reign-自由驰骋"><a class="header" href="#free-reign-自由驰骋">Free Reign 自由驰骋</a></h2>
<p>So, with a firm understanding that their behaviors will for the most part be excused, they are free to practice the feminine form of plate theory unhindered by social reprisal. The feminine plate spinning involves much more than sex though. Remember that attention is the coin of the realm in female society. The capacity to command attention determines self-esteem, peer status, sexual selectivity, and a host of other factors in a woman’s life, so spinning plates becomes more than just a “which guy am I gonna bang tonight” prospect. This dynamic and these factors are what makes women natural plate spinners. Even when a woman has no intention of ever becoming sexual with a “maybe” guy, his attention still has some value to her. It appeals to the long term prospective for security that’s a continuous subroutine running in her hindbrain. This is the rudimentary psychology behind hypergamy.
因此，在深刻理解其行为大多会得到宽恕的前提下，她们得以无拘无束地实践女性版的“盘子理论”，免受社会报复的阻碍。然而，女性盘旋的技艺远不止于性。记住，在女性社会中，关注即是流通的货币。能否吸引注意力，决定了自尊、同伴地位、择偶选择以及女性生活中的诸多其他因素，因此，旋转盘子超越了单纯的“今晚我该和哪个男人共度”的考量。正是这种动态和这些因素，使得女性天生擅长旋转盘子。即便一位女性无意与某个“可能”的男性发生性关系，他的关注对她仍具有一定价值。这迎合了她后脑中持续运行的、对长期安全保障的潜在需求。这便是超偶选择背后的基本心理学原理。</p>
<p>Now, combine all of this with women’s native language – covert communication – and it’s natural for a man to assume that a woman will only ever become sexual with one guy at a time. This serves the latent purpose of keeping him in a kind of stasis. If he assumes women will only be sexual under the precondition of commitment she is free to spin plates (essentially weighing options) as she pleases and sample at will what she sees as in her hypergamic best interest at the time. If the carrot looks good enough the guy will patiently pull the cart until such time as another, better carrot comes along. Either way he’s in that stasis. If a guy were to see her social and psychological machinations for what they are, he’d never pull the cart – so it serves women best that men think commitment should always be required for intimacy, even in the face of her behavior directly contradicting this.</p>
<p>现在，将这一切与女性的母语——隐秘沟通相结合，男性自然会认为女性只会同时与一个男性发生性关系。这实际上起到了一种让他保持停滞状态的作用。如果他认为女性只有在承诺的前提下才会发生性行为，那么她就可以自由地“旋转盘子”（本质上是在权衡选择），随心所欲地尝试她当时认为符合自己最佳利益的事情。如果胡萝卜看起来足够诱人，这个男人会耐心地拉着车，直到另一个更好的胡萝卜出现。无论哪种情况，他都处于那种停滞状态。如果一个男人能看清她的社交和心理策略的本质，他就永远不会拉车——因此，对女性最有利的是让男性认为亲密关系总是需要承诺的，即使她的行为直接与此相矛盾。</p>
<h2 id="plate-wars-板块战争"><a class="header" href="#plate-wars-板块战争">Plate Wars 板块战争</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, this social dynamic serves as a very effective weapon for women against each other. As I stated in the last Plate Theory post, competition anxiety between women is something men can exploit for their own plate spinning, but the reason it is useful is because women so readily use it against each other. For a woman to say another is a “slut” translates into an overt betrayal of this unspoken social contrivance. She essentially is saying, “the rules are that women require commitment for sex, but here’s one who’ll never be worthy of any guy’s commitment because she wont play by the rules you suckers think she will.”</p>
<p>最后，这种社会动态成为女性相互对抗的非常有效的武器。正如我在上一篇 Plate Theory 文章中所说，女性之间的竞争焦虑是男性可以利用来为自己转盘子的，但之所以有用，是因为女性很容易用它来对付彼此。一个女性称另一个女性为“荡妇”，实际上是对这种未言明的社会机制的公然背叛。她本质上是在说：“规则是女性需要承诺才能发生性关系，但这里有一个永远不会值得任何男性的承诺，因为她不会遵守你们这些傻瓜认为她会遵守的规则。”</p>
<p>She is tacitly disqualified for a man’s commitment and is, at least in the accusing woman’s mind, a reduced threat in this feminine competition. She becomes exposed in the same game they’re all playing and in being so loses attention and therefore status and personal esteem. It seems petty to guys, but it’s really intra-gender warfare. Think of how many times an exceptionally attractive woman, that is completely anonymous to a group of women you happen to be with, berate her based on appearance alone. “She’s must be a tramp if she dressed like that.” These are the same women who’ll berate a man for basing his estimation of a woman on her outer appearance. This is feminine competition anxiety. Ask a woman to name the most attractive female actress they can think of. Odds are it will be a woman (who as a guy you’d never think of) who presents the least threat of this anxiety.</p>
<p>她被默认为不具备男性的承诺能力，至少在指责她的女性心中，她在这种女性竞争中威胁程度降低。她在这场她们都在参与的游戏中暴露无遗，也因此失去了关注，进而失去了地位和个人自尊。这在男性看来可能显得小气，但实际上是性别内部的战争。想象一下，有多少次一个对一群女性来说完全陌生的极具吸引力的女性，仅凭外表就被她们批评。“她穿成那样，肯定是个荡妇。”这些女性同样会因为一个男人仅凭外表来评价一个女性而批评他。这就是女性竞争焦虑。让一个女性说出她们能想到的最具吸引力的女演员。很可能是一个（作为男性你从未考虑过的）女性，她呈现出的这种焦虑威胁最小。</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as I’m fond of saying, women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. The girl who bangs the hot guy at the foam party in Cancun on Spring Break within 5 minutes of meeting him is the same girl who want’s you to believe that they’ll only fuck one guy at a time and then after commitment. All women are sexual, you just need to be the right guy at the right time for the job.</p>
<p>先生们，正如我常说的，女人会做爱。她们可能不会和你做，也可能不会和我做，但她们会和某个人做。那个在春假坎昆泡沫派对上，五分钟内就和性感男子上床的女孩，也是那个想让你相信她们一次只会和一个男人上床，然后才会在承诺之后的女人。所有女人都有性欲，你只需要在正确的时间成为那个正确的男人。</p>

<p><em>Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor</em></p>
<p><em>Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.</em></p>
<p><em>过多曝光导致价值下降：你越频繁地出现在他人视野和耳语中，你的形象就越显平凡。若你已在某个群体中确立地位，适时地暂时退出，反而能引发更多讨论，甚至更受敬仰。你必须学会何时抽身。通过稀缺性创造价值。</em></p>
<p>Plate Theory is for your benefit, not for women’s. That might sound harsh, but it’s a method intended to increase your value as a commodity that works on two levels. First, the external – by practicing honest, non-exclusive dating you communicate to your prospective plates that you are in demand. I’ve gone so far as to tell men to foster this sense by never answering the phone from Friday to Sunday evening, even when they have no other plans. The perception that your attention is sought after increases it’s value – it’s when men are too eager to get with a woman that their attention becomes worthless and IL declines. Nothing serves a man better than having 3 or 4 women competing for his exclusive attention and fostering in them that feminine competitivie anxiety in as subtle and covert a way as possible. It’s a real art that women are all too familiar with. Women are natural plate theorists, they simply use their varying degrees of physical attractiveness to line their plates up.
板块理论是为了你的利益，而非女性的。这听起来可能有些刺耳，但它是一种旨在从两个层面提升你作为商品价值的方法。首先，是外在层面——通过实践诚实、非独占性的约会，你向潜在的板块传达出你备受追捧的信息。我甚至建议男性培养这种感觉，从周五到周日晚上不接电话，即便他们没有其他安排。你的关注被渴望的认知提升了其价值——当男性过于急切地想要接近女性时，他们的关注就变得一文不值，吸引力水平也随之下降。没有什么比拥有三四个女性竞争他的独占关注更能彰显男性魅力，并以尽可能微妙和隐蔽的方式激发她们的竞争焦虑更有效了。这是一门真正的艺术，而女性对此再熟悉不过。女性天生就是板块理论家，她们只是利用自己不同程度的身体吸引力来排列她们的板块。</p>
<p>Secondly, plate theory is for a man’s own internal benefit. As I said in my original thread, it’s much easier for a man not to give a shit if he truly doesn’t give a shit. It’s far easier to deal with women on the basis of indifference when you have a subconscious knowledge that there are at least 3 other women who’ll be happy to have your attention if one plays games with you.
其次，板块理论是为了个人内在利益。正如我在原帖中所说，如果一个人真的不在乎，那么他更容易不放在心上。当你潜意识里知道至少还有另外三位女性会因得到你的关注而高兴，如果其中一位对你耍花样，那么以冷漠的态度对待女性会容易得多。</p>
<p>You will invariably pass most shit tests in this fashion. The reason men fail most shit tests is because they subconsciously telegraph too much interest in a single woman. Essentially a shit test is used by women to determine one, or a combination of these factors:
你将以这种方式必然通过大多数的考验。男性在大多数考验中失败的原因，是因为他们在潜意识中对单一女性流露出过多的兴趣。本质上，女性使用考验来确定一个或多个因素的组合：</p>
<p>a.) Confidence – first and foremost
a.) 信心——首要之务
b.) Options – is this guy really into me because I’m ‘special’ or am I his only option?
b.) 选项——这家伙真的因为我“特别”而喜欢我，还是我只是他的唯一选择？
c.) Security – is this guy capable of providing me with long term security?
c.) 安全——这个人能否为我提供长期的安全保障？</p>
<p>By practicing Plate Theory, your mental attitude will be such (or should be such) that you will pass most shit test based simply on this practice. Abundance thinking is the root of Plate Theory. A lot has been written about approaching women (and really life in general) from a position of Abundance. People often make the mistake of assuming that having a wide variety of choices tends to cheapen the commodity, and to a degree this is accurate, but it also allows for a better, learned awareness of which choice amongst the pool is common and which is of higher quality.
通过实践板块理论，你的心态将变得如此（或应当如此），即仅凭这一实践，你便能通过大多数的考验。丰盛思维是板块理论的根基。关于如何以丰盛的心态接近女性（乃至生活中的方方面面），已有大量论述。人们常犯的错误是，认为拥有广泛的选择会降低商品的价值，这在某种程度上是准确的，但它同时也促进了更深入、更有见识的辨识能力，从而区分出众多选择中哪些是普遍的，哪些是更优质的。</p>
<p>,…but Rollo, I’m so busy that I have no choice but to ignore and postpone. They sense it and seek me out. I worry that I’ll create crazies. My weekends are jammed. At what point do we stop?
但是，Rollo，我实在太忙了，别无选择只能忽视和推迟。他们察觉到了，便找上门来。我担心这会制造出麻烦。我的周末都排满了。我们何时才能停下来？</p>
<p>This is a the best problem you can have. You’ve successfully flipped the script; you’ve gotten to a point where it becomes instinctive and your plates actively seek out your attention. By default, you’re creating value by scarcity. At what point do you stop? How old are you? If you’re under 30 stay in the game. If you’re over 30, stay in the game, but cool things off occasionally – the only time a man should even contemplate monogamy is after experiencing abundance. If you’re innundated with women occupying your weekends, consider hooking up with a proven plate on a Thursday evening and reserve your weekends for your other pursuits.
这是你能拥有的最佳问题。你已成功扭转局面；你已达到一种本能的境界，你的盘子们会主动寻求你的关注。默认情况下，你通过稀缺性创造价值。何时该停下？你多大了？如果你未满 30 岁，继续游戏。如果你已过 30 岁，继续游戏，但偶尔降温——一个男人只有在体验过丰盈之后，才应考虑一夫一妻制。如果你被占据周末的女性淹没，不妨考虑在周四晚上与一位可靠的盘子约会，将周末留给其他追求。</p>
<p>Also, don’t be afraid to clear your schedule to hang out with friends or do other things that interest you. Remember, scarcity increases value. Too many guys think that plate spinning is something that needs a constant effort, it doesn’t. In fact applying yourself equally across all your active plates only pushes you closer to settling for one or two. Most guys think that they have to continually spin their plates, you don’t; if you’re doing it correctly they’ll spin themselves for you. The anxiety is that if you don’t keep applying attention to any one plate she’ll lose interest and fall off. Sometimes this is the case and you have to be prepared to accept it, some plates have to break in order to spin more, and that’s OK. More often than not however, your scarcity will create value and mystique, thus they will pursue you for their affirmation.
此外，不要害怕清空日程去与朋友相聚或做其他你感兴趣的事情。记住，稀缺性会提升价值。太多人认为盘旋需要持续的努力，其实不然。事实上，在所有活跃的盘子上均匀分配精力只会让你更倾向于安定于一两个。大多数人认为他们必须不断旋转盘子，你不必；如果做得对，它们会自行旋转。焦虑在于，如果你不持续关注任何一个盘子，她会失去兴趣并掉落。有时确实如此，你必须准备好接受，有些盘子必须破碎才能旋转更多，这没关系。然而，更常见的是，你的稀缺性会创造价值和神秘感，从而她们会追求你以获得肯定。</p>
<p>Plate theory of course can be a means to an LTR, but bear in mind that it’s essential that you practice it long enough and effectively enough to determine what a quality woman means to you and how to recognize her. As with most Game skills, the AFC will use them to some degree of success up to the point that he finds his idealized “girl of his dreams” and launch into a self-destructive LTR because his idealization was based on juvenile impressions rather than a mature understanding of what a quality woman’s characteristics are. This is all due to a lack of concrete experience.
板块理论当然可以成为实现长期关系的一种手段，但请记住，关键在于你必须足够长时间且有效地实践它，以确定对你而言优质女性的含义以及如何识别她。与大多数游戏技能一样，初级者在一定程度上运用它们会取得成功，直到他找到理想化的“梦中女孩”，然后因理想化基于幼稚印象而非对优质女性特质的成熟理解，而陷入自我毁灭的长期关系。这一切都源于缺乏具体经验。</p>
<p>Spin plates for as long as possible, because once you do commit to an LTR, even with the tightest of Game you will lose a measure of the competitive anxiety that made your attentions valuable to any one woman. All your plates fall off AND the girl you’re engaged in an LTR with relaxes. This is root of why men find that the woman they had hot sweaty monkey sex with when they were dating becomes more sexually reserved a few months after they’re a couple. The competitive anxiety is relieved and therefore sexual frequency and quality is no longer a proving trait for her. That’s not to say there aren’t methods to stoke this anxiety in an LTR, but, by comparisson to being single, the frame of the relationship doesn’t have to be contested when she and you understand that she is your only source of intimacy and sex. In a committed relationship, you simply cannot spin plates.
尽可能长时间地旋转盘子，因为一旦你决定投身长期关系（LTR），即便你拥有最精湛的技巧，也会失去一部分让女性珍视你的竞争性焦虑。所有盘子都会掉落，而与你处于 LTR 中的女孩也会放松下来。这就是为什么男人发现，在约会时与他们有过激情性爱的女人，在成为情侣几个月后变得更为性保守。竞争性焦虑的缓解使得性频率和质量不再成为她的证明特质。这并不是说在 LTR 中没有方法来激发这种焦虑，但相较于单身状态，当她和你都明白她是你的唯一亲密和性来源时，关系的框架无需再被争夺。在一段承诺的关系中，你无法再旋转盘子。</p>

<p>The following was a timely question by SoSuave member “OnTheWayUp”;
以下是 SoSuave 会员“OnTheWayUp”提出的一个及时问题；</p>
<ul>
<li>Just wanted to find out: who do you talk to about aspects of game with off this site? I’m talking here about “game” in the broadest sense of the term, so pick-up, but also self-esteem, how to keep a relationship healthy, the roles of men and women in society etc.*
只是想了解一下：关于游戏方面的内容，你通常会与谁交流，而不局限于此网站？我这里所说的“游戏”是指该词最广泛的意义，包括搭讪技巧、自我价值感、如何维持健康关系，以及男女在社会中的角色等。</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My experience with voicing the views advocated on here in public has nearly always been negative. I have 3 – 4 good male friends who are interested in pick-up (one has read the Mystery Method, for example), and they love it. But these friends are the exception rather than the rule. My parents (beta dad, controlling mum) think my attitude towards women is sexist and my opinion of ONSs “disgusting.” Just about everybody I know subscribes to the Disney/ soulmate view of relationships, and some of my contemporaries (I’m 21) are even starting to settle down and get married. God help them. Talking to girls in bed about what they find attractive in a man is interesting, if only to see the extent to which they delude themselves, but ultimately counter-productive, since a woman (tacitly) expects a man to know how to express his sexuality.</em>
在公开场合表达这里所倡导的观点，我的经历几乎总是负面的。我有三四个对搭讪感兴趣的好朋友，其中一位甚至读过《谜男方法》，他们对此非常热衷。但这些朋友只是少数。我的父母（温和的父亲，控制欲强的母亲）认为我对女性的态度带有性别歧视，对一夜情的看法“令人作呕”。我认识的几乎每个人都信奉迪士尼式的灵魂伴侣关系观，甚至我的一些同龄人（我 21 岁）已经开始安定下来步入婚姻。愿上帝保佑他们。与床上的女孩讨论她们对男性吸引力的看法颇有趣味，尽管这能揭示她们自我欺骗的程度，但最终却适得其反，因为女性（默许地）期望男性懂得如何表达自己的性魅力。</p>
<p><em>Can we as men ever talk about these things in public? What are your experiences?</em>
我们作为男性能在公共场合谈论这些事吗？你的经历是怎样的？</p>
<p>Before I begin, let me say that I think it’s encouraging to see such an insightful question posed by so young a Man.
在我开始之前，请允许我表达，看到如此年轻的人提出这样有见地的问题，我感到非常鼓舞。</p>
<p><em>Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.</em>
<em>墨菲斯：矩阵是一个系统，尼奥。那个系统是我们的敌人。但当你身处其中，环顾四周，你看到了什么？商人、教师、律师、木匠。正是这些我们试图拯救的人的头脑。但在我们做到之前，这些人仍然是那个系统的一部分，这使他们成为我们的敌人。你必须明白，这些人中的大多数还没有准备好被拔除。而且他们中有许多人已经如此习惯，如此绝望地依赖于这个系统，以至于他们会为之战斗，保护它。</em></p>
<p>Every random chump within earshot of your conversation about Game, about your ‘changed’ way of seeing inter-gender relations, about your most objective critical observations of how women ‘are’, etc. – understand, that chump waits everyday for an opportunity to “correct” you in as public a way as he’s able to muster. That AFC who’s been fed on a steady diet of noble intent, with ambitions of endearing a woman’s intimacy through his unique form of chivalry; that guy, he’s aching for an opportunity to prove his quality by publicly redressing a “villain” like you for your chauvinism. Even under the conditions of relative anonymity (like the internet), he’ll still cling to that want of proving his uniqueness just on the off chance that a woman might read his rebuff and be fatefully attracted to him.</p>
<p>每个偶然听闻你关于游戏、关于你“改变”的性别关系视角、关于你对女性“本质”最客观批判观察的闲人——请明白，那个闲人每天都在等待机会，以他能聚集的最大公众方式来“纠正”你。那个一直接受高尚意图熏陶、梦想通过其独特骑士精神赢得女性亲密的 AFC；那个家伙，他渴望有机会通过公开纠正你这样的“恶棍”来证明自己的品质，因为你表现出的大男子主义。即使在相对匿名的条件下（如互联网），他仍会坚持证明自己独特性的欲望，只因万一有女性读到他的反驳，可能会被命运般地吸引。</p>
<p>This is the bread and butter of the White Knight beta. It’s best to assume that most guys who pick up on just your Game vibe, to say nothing of overtly talking about it, are going to side with the feminine imperative by default. For practitioners of Beta Game (which is to say the better part of 90% of guys) this is an organic opportunity to identify with women and engage in the same shaming conventions women use without the fear of having it seem contrived.</p>
<p>这是白骑士测试版的核心内容。最好假设，大多数仅凭你的游戏氛围，更不用说公开谈论它的人，默认情况下都会支持女性主导原则。对于贝塔游戏（即大约 90%的男性）的实践者来说，这是一个自然的机会，可以与女性产生共鸣，并采用她们使用的相同羞辱惯例，而不必担心显得做作。</p>
<p>Now this is the mechanics of it, but the rabbit hole goes deeper than that. For the Beta Game that our noble white knight is so invested in to work, he depends on an assumed system. He depends upon reaffirming his assumed understanding of how to best achieve a woman’s intimacy (sex). He must reaffirm that presumption BY defending it and looking for opportunities to show he adheres to the feminine imperative (or the version of the imperative he’s been taught to believe). His Game, his ego-invested identity IS literally dependent upon that system. So not only is he defending his Game and his ego, be he’s also defending the social architecture that makes his Beta Game even possible.</p>
<p>现在，这是其机制，但这个兔子洞比那更深。为了让我们的高贵白骑士如此投入的 Beta 游戏运作，他依赖于一个假定的系统。他依赖于重申他对如何最好地获得女性亲密（性）的假定理解。他必须通过捍卫这一假设并寻找机会展示他遵守女性主导原则（或他所学到的原则版本）来重申这一假设。他的游戏，他自我投入的身份实际上依赖于那个系统。因此，他不仅在捍卫他的游戏和自我，还在捍卫使他的 Beta 游戏成为可能的社会架构。</p>
<p>You see, when an AFC clings to the mental schemas that make up an AFC mindset it requires a constant need for affirmation and reinforcement, particularly in light of a glaring lack of verifiable success with women while clinging to, and behaving in accordance with the mindset. AFCs are like crabs in a barrel – once one gets to the top to climb out another drags him back in. The AFC needs other AFCs to affirm his blatantly obvious lack of success. He needs other AFCs to tell him, “don’t worry just be yourself” or “she’s just not a quality woman because she can’t see how great a guy you are.”</p>
<p>你看，当一个 AFC（平均失败者）坚持那些构成 AFC 心态的心理模式时，他需要不断的肯定和强化，尤其是在面对与女性交往中明显缺乏可验证成功的情况下，仍然坚持并按照这种心态行事。AFC 们就像桶里的螃蟹——一旦有一个爬到顶端试图逃脱，另一个就会把他拖回去。AFC 需要其他 AFC 来肯定他显而易见的失败。他需要其他 AFC 告诉他，“别担心，做你自己就好”或者“她不是优质女性，因为她看不到你有多棒。”</p>
<p>So when an AFC finally does get a second date and then finally does get laid it becomes the ultimate validation for his mindset. “See, you just have to be a patient nice guy and the right ONE really does come along.” This is when the self-righteous phase begins and he can begin telling his PUA friends that Beta Game does work, and he’s “getting some” now without all the Positive Masculinity claptrap. In actuality he rationalizes away all of the conditions that lead up to him getting the girlfriend and the fundamental flaw that he’s settling for a woman “who’d fuck him”, but this doesn’t stop him from claiming a moral high ground. His long wait is over and he’s finally hit White Knight pay-dirt.</p>
<p>因此，当一个 AFC 最终获得第二次约会并最终成功上床时，这成为他心态的终极验证。“看，你只需做一个耐心的好人，对的那个人真的会出现。”这时，自以为是阶段开始，他可以开始告诉他的 PUA 朋友们，Beta 游戏确实有效，他现在“有所收获”，而不需要那些正向男性气质的废话。实际上，他合理化了自己获得女友的所有条件和根本缺陷，即他满足于一个“愿意和他上床”的女人，但这并没有阻止他宣称道德高地。他漫长的等待结束了，他终于达到了白骑士的回报。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="average-frustrated-chump"><a class="header" href="#average-frustrated-chump">Average Frustrated Chump</a></h1>
<p>In the “community” there’s a lot of want for better terms. One of the major obstacles in the average guy’s path to unplugging is really coming to terms with the ‘terms’ we use. Somewhere on the net I’m sure there’s a glossary of the common acronyms used in the “manosphere” (I hate that term too) outlining the various shorthand we use. Some of these terms have gone mainstream and I’m beginning to see even “legitimate” online journalists use LTR (long term relationship) or ONS (one night stand) somewhat regularly, meaning there’s a common perception that others will already know what they mean.</p>
<p>在“社群”中，人们普遍渴望更恰当的术语。普通人在脱离束缚之路上的主要障碍之一，实际上是真正理解我们所使用的“术语”。我确信在网络的某个角落，存在着一个关于“男性领域”（我也讨厌这个称呼）常用缩略语的词汇表，概述了我们使用的各种简写。其中一些术语已经进入主流，我开始看到甚至“正规”的网络记者也相对频繁地使用 LTR（长期关系）或 ONS（一夜情），这意味着人们普遍认为其他人已经知道它们的含义。</p>
<p>The reason this is a hurdle for a lot of plugged-in guys is because it seems almost juvenile, like a treehouse club for preteen boys. For me to draw comparisons of an acculturated, feminine social paradigm to the central plot of the Matrix movies, admittedly, on the surface that seems kind of silly. It’s an apt comparison and a useful allegory when you understand the concepts behind it, but for a guy just coming to grasp it while being immersed in a feminine-primary socialization for his whole life, it dosen’t click. And predictably, women invested in that same socialization see the terminology as little more than little boys holed up in their treehouse, throwing rocks at the girls below.</p>
<p>这个障碍对许多沉浸在社交中的男性来说存在的原因，是因为它看起来几乎像是幼稚的，就像是为青春期前的男孩们准备的树屋俱乐部。对我来说，将一个文化熏陶下的、女性主导的社交范式与《黑客帝国》系列电影的核心情节相提并论，坦白说，乍看之下似乎有些荒谬。然而，当你理解其背后的概念时，这是一个恰当的比喻和有用的寓言。但对于一个一生都在女性主导的社会化环境中成长，刚刚开始理解这一点的男性来说，这并不容易理解。可以预见的是，那些同样投入于这种社会化的女性，会将这些术语视为不过是躲在树屋里的小男孩，向楼下的女孩们扔石头。</p>
<p>However, like any new developing science or art or technology there is always going to be a need to codify abstract concepts. We lack better terms so we’re forced to create new ones to represent new concepts.</p>
<p>然而，如同任何新兴发展的科学、艺术或技术一样，总需要将抽象概念规范化。由于缺乏更恰当的术语，我们被迫创造新词来表达新概念。</p>
<p>The AFC – average frustrated chump – was coined almost a decade ago with Mystery method. It’s seen a lot of modification over the years, becoming almost synonymous the use of the term Beta (beta male) or Herb (herbivorous male). In fact, although I use it often, I rarely read AFC in PUA blogs, forums or the ‘community’ at large. Regardless of the terminology, the concept is really the crux of the term. Most AFCs, most guys looking in from the outside, can relate to the idea of what an average frustrated chump is – they can identify with it. Once they begin unplugging, the AFC idea comes into better focus and, usually with some discomfort, they realize how that term applies to themselves:</p>
<p>AFC——即平均挫败者——这一术语几乎在十年前随着神秘方法诞生。多年来，它经历了诸多变化，几乎与“贝塔男”或“草食男”等词汇同义。事实上，尽管我经常使用它，但在 PUA 博客、论坛或整个社区中，我很少看到 AFC 这个词。无论术语如何变化，其核心概念才是关键。大多数 AFC，即那些从外部观察的普通男性，都能理解平均挫败者的含义——他们能产生共鸣。当他们开始觉醒时，AFC 的概念变得更加清晰，通常伴随着些许不适，他们意识到这个术语是如何适用于自己的：</p>
<p>Qualities of an AFC AFC 的特质</p>
<ul>
<li>ONEitis – First and foremost. 单恋症 - 首要且关键。</li>
<li>Subscribes to feminine idealizations.  追求女性理想化形象。</li>
<li>Supplication is supportive. To comply with gender equalism she must increase, so he must decrease, regardless of how subtly this is realized.  恳求是支持性的。为了遵循性别平等主义，她必须增加，而他必须减少，无论这一过程实现得多么微妙。</li>
<li>The Savior Schema –reciprocation of intimacy for problems solved.  救世主模式——以亲密回报解决的问题。</li>
<li>The Martyr Schema – the more you sacrifice the more it shows devotion.  烈士模式——牺牲越多，越显忠诚。</li>
<li>The ‘Friends’ Debt – LJBF and the pseudo-friendship as a means to prospective intimacy.  “朋友”债务——LJBF 与作为潜在亲密关系手段的伪友谊。</li>

</ul>
<p>This is anything but a comprehensive list. There are far more, but my intent here isn’t to provide you with a list of criteria that qualifies an AFC (“you might be a chump if,..”), rather it’s to give you some basic understanding to clarify the term, and round out the idea of what an AFC is. Needless to say these mental schema are some of the impediments to unplugging, or helping another man unplug, from his old way of thinking. As I’m fond of repeating, unplugging chumps from the Matrix is dirty work. Expect to be met with a LOT of resistance, but understanding what dynamics you may harbor yourself or those that a friend might cling to will help you in moving past the years of social conditioning. It’s thankless work, and more often than not you’ll also be facing a constant barrage of shit tests (from both women and feminized men) and ridicule in your efforts. Be prepared for it. Unplugging chumps is triage – save those you can, read last rites to the dying.</p>
<p>这绝非一份详尽无遗的清单。实际上远不止这些，但我的目的并非提供一份符合 AFC（“你可能是傻瓜如果……”）标准的评判标准列表，而是旨在为您阐明这一术语，并完善对 AFC 概念的理解。毋庸置疑，这些心理模式是阻碍人们摆脱旧思维模式，或帮助他人摆脱的障碍之一。正如我常说的，从矩阵中解救傻瓜是艰巨的任务。你将面临巨大的阻力，但了解自己可能持有的动态或朋友可能坚守的观念，将有助于你超越多年的社会教化。这是一项吃力不讨好的工作，而且你往往会遭遇来自女性及女性化男性的持续不断的考验和嘲笑。对此要有心理准备。解救傻瓜如同急救——尽力拯救那些尚有机会的，对濒死者则给予最后的慰藉。</p>

<p>I’m sorry to break this to you, but there is no such thing as a long distance relationship. That’s correct, you have no relationship. An LDR simply does not meet the criteria necessary for it to be considered a legitimate relationship. There is no reciprocity of anything more than words passing over a phone line or an IM text. Understand me here – you have no relationship. You have self-assumed accountability, self-assumed liability and internalized responsibilities to be loyal to this person. You are entertaining a commitment to fidelity with an idealization, and ignoring what everyone outside of your LDR will regularly tell you is insanity. LDRs are one of the more insidious forms of ONEitis.
很抱歉要告诉你这个事实，但所谓“异地恋”并不存在。没错，你并没有真正的恋爱关系。异地恋根本不符合被视为合法关系所需的必要条件。除了通过电话线传递的话语或即时消息文本，双方之间没有任何实质性的互惠。请理解我的意思——你并没有恋爱关系。你只是自认为有责任、自担风险，并内化了忠诚于对方的义务。你正沉溺于对一个理想化形象的忠诚承诺，却忽视了外界对异地恋的普遍看法——这简直是疯狂。异地恋是单相思中更为隐蔽的一种形式。</p>
<p>LDRs are the most easily identifiable form of ONEitis, and it would be laughable if it weren’t so damaging to a guy’s life progression. The LDR man generally sacrifices years of his life in this pitiable effort to pursue his ‘soulmate’ across the planet or even a hundred miles away. The very thought of refuting the idea that an LDR can work is equatable to denying his belief this fantasized ONEitis fueled idealization that he’s swallowed for the better part of his life. It’s easy to criticize an LDR in the terms of questioning either party’s earnestness and fidelity in entertaining an LDR and this is usually the tact that most people giving advice on LDRs follow. One or both parties are or will ‘cheat’ on the other over the course of time, its true, but LDRs are far more telling of a mentality that results in much more damaging consequences as a result of deeply conditioned self-expectations and fears.
远距离恋爱（LDRs）是最容易识别的“唯一症”（ONEitis）形式，若非其对男性生活进程的破坏性，这本可一笑置之。陷入远距离恋爱的男性往往在这可悲的追求中牺牲数年光阴，只为追逐他心目中的“灵魂伴侣”，哪怕相隔千里甚至仅百里之遥。质疑远距离恋爱能否成功的想法，无异于否认他多年来深信不疑、由“唯一症”幻想所驱动的理想化信念。从质疑双方在远距离恋爱中的真诚与忠诚度来批评远距离恋爱固然容易，这也是多数人在给出远距离恋爱建议时所采取的策略。确实，随着时间的推移，一方或双方可能会对另一方不忠，但远距离恋爱更揭示了一种心态，这种心态源于根深蒂固的自我期待与恐惧，其导致的后果远为严重。</p>
<p>I can’t begin to list the number of otherwise intelligent and ambitious men I’ve known who’ve drastically altered the course of their lives to follow their ONE. Men who’ve changed their majors in college, who’ve selected or switched universities, men who’ve applied for jobs in states they would never have considered, accepted jobs that are sub-standard to their ambitions or qualifications, men who’ve renounced former religions and men who’ve moved across the planet all in an effort to better accommodate an idealized woman with whom they’ve played pseudo-boyfriend with over the course of an LDR; only to find that she wasn’t the person they thought she was and were depressive over the gravity that their decisions played in their lives.
我无法一一列举那些原本聪明且有抱负的男性，他们为了追随心中的唯一，不惜彻底改变自己的人生轨迹。这些男性中，有的在大学更换专业，有的选择或转学至不同大学，有的申请了从未考虑过的州的工作，接受了与其抱负或资历不符的职位，有的甚至放弃了原有的宗教信仰，还有的跨越全球迁居，只为更好地适应那位在长期异地恋中扮演着伪男友角色的理想化女性；然而最终却发现她并非心目中的那个人，因自己决策对生活产生的重大影响而陷入抑郁。</p>
<p>An LDR is akin to a LJBF, but writ large and festering in a man’s life. You play surrogate boyfriend, voluntarily accepting and internalizing all of the responsibilities and accountabilities of being a woman’s exclusive, monogamous partner with no expectation of reciprocating intimacy or sexuality in the immediate future. However an LDR is worse than a LJBF arrangement since it pervasively locks a man into a success or failure mentality with regards to the relationship actually being legitimate. After all, she’s agreed to remain his girlfriend (from miles away) and if he’s the one to falter it’s his lack of perseverance in this  ONEitis ego-investment that dooms them. Once the LDR inevitably ends he’s the one left with the self-doubt, he’s the one beating himself up over wasting time, money and effort and he’s the one feeling guilty whether he or she is the true ‘cheater’.
异地恋类似于“就这样做朋友吧”，但规模更大且在男人的生活中溃烂。你扮演着代理男友的角色，自愿接受并内化了成为女性唯一、一夫一妻制伴侣的所有责任和义务，却对短期内获得情感或性方面的回报不抱任何期望。然而，异地恋比“就这样做朋友吧”的安排更糟糕，因为它普遍将男人锁定在一种成功或失败的心态中，关于这段关系是否真实有效。毕竟，她同意（从远处）继续做他的女朋友，如果他动摇了，那么他在这段“唯一”的自我投资中缺乏坚持，将导致他们关系的终结。一旦异地恋不可避免地结束，他便是那个留下自我怀疑的人，他因浪费时间、金钱和精力而自责，无论谁是真正的“背叛者”，他都感到内疚。</p>
<p>An LDR is like having an invisible friend with whom you’re constantly considering the course of your actions with. Consider the personal, romantic, familial, educational, career, personal maturity and growth opportunities that you’ve limited yourself from or never had a chance to experience because of this invisible friend. When you finally divorce yourself from this invisible friend, will it have all been worth it? Guys cling to LDRs because they’ve yet to learn that Rejection is better than Regret. AFCs will nurse along an LDR for years because it seems the better option when compared with actually going out and meeting new women who represent a potential for real rejection. They think its better to stick with the ‘sure thing’, but it’s the long term regret that is the inevitable result of an LDR that is life damaging. Nothing reeks of desperation or verifies a lack of confidence more than a guy who self-righteously proclaims he’s in an LDR. Women see you coming a mile off, because you are a guy without options, clinging to his one previously realized option. In fact the only reason a man entertains an LDR is due to a lack of options. If you had more plates spinning an LDR would never look like a good idea.
异地恋就像拥有一个无形的朋友，你时刻都在考虑与他的行动方向。想想那些因这个无形朋友而错过的个人、浪漫、家庭、教育、职业、个人成熟和成长的机会。当你最终摆脱这个无形朋友时，这一切是否都值得？男人们执着于异地恋，因为他们尚未明白拒绝总好过后悔。AFC（平均水平男）会维持异地恋多年，因为与真正走出去结识可能带来真实拒绝的新女性相比，这似乎是更好的选择。他们认为坚持“确定的事”更好，但长期后悔才是异地恋不可避免的、对生活有害的结果。没有什么比一个自以为是地宣称自己处于异地恋的男人更能散发出绝望或验证其缺乏自信了。女性一眼就能看穿你，因为你是一个没有选择的男人，紧紧抓住曾经实现过的唯一选项。事实上，一个男人考虑异地恋的唯一原因就是缺乏选择。 如果你有更多盘子在旋转，异地恋看起来绝不会是个好主意。</p>
<p>And finally, it’s not uncommon to see the “not in my case” defense offered about how you actually DO see your invisible friend once every 4 or six months. To this I’ll say again, what opportunities are you censoring yourself from experiencing by playing house with a woman you only see this often? Do you honestly think you’re the exception to the rule? The truth is you’re molding your lifestyle around what you hope your relationship will be in the future – that’s no way to live.
最后，你可能会提出“我的情况不同”的辩解，声称实际上每四个月或六个月你确实会见到你的那位隐形朋友。对此，我要再次强调，你因为与一位如此不常见面的女性“过家家”而错过了哪些体验的机会？你真的认为自己是个例外，能打破常规吗？事实上，你正围绕着对未来关系的期望来塑造自己的生活方式——这不是一种明智的生活态度。</p>

<p><em>Women have boyfriends and girlfriends. If you’re not fucking her, you’re her girlfriend.</em>
女性既有男朋友也有女朋友。如果你没有与她发生性关系，那你就是她的女朋友。</p>
<p><em>“Rollo, how do I get out of the Friend-Zone?” Never allow yourself to get into it.</em>
“Rollo，我如何才能走出‘朋友区’？”永远不要让自己陷入其中。</p>
<p>Women have used the LJBF (“let just be friends”) rejection for a hundred years because it serves an ego preservation function for her. To a greater or lesser degree, women require attention and the more they have of it the more affirmation they experience, both personally and socially. The LJBF rejection is a Social Convention that has classically ensured a woman can reject a man yet still maintain his previous attention. It also puts the responsibility for the rejection back on his shoulders since, should he decline the ‘offer of friendship’, he is then responsible for entertaining this ‘friendship’.</p>
<p>女性使用“只是朋友”（LJBF）这一拒绝方式已有百年历史，因为它对她具有自我保护的功能。或多或少，女性需要关注，而她们获得的关注越多，个人和社会层面的肯定就越丰富。LJBF 拒绝是一种社会惯例，传统上确保女性可以拒绝男性，同时仍能维持他之前的关注。此外，这种拒绝方式还将拒绝的责任推回给男性，因为如果他拒绝“友谊的提议”，那么他就得承担起维系这段“友谊”的责任。</p>
<p>This of course has the potential to backfire on women these days since the standard AFC response will be to accept an LJBF rejection in the mistaken hope of ‘proving’ himself worthy of her intimacy by being the perfect ‘surrogate boyfriend’ – fulfilling all her attention and loyalty prerequisites with no expectation of reciprocating her own intimacy. I should also point out that this situation is analogous to men using women as “fuck buddies” – fulfilling all his sexual availability needs with no expectations of reciprocating commitment. Needless to say this merely positions the new “friend” into being the ’emotionally supportive’ Beta counterpart to the indifferent Alpha she’ll consistently bang and then complain about – also popularly known as the Emotional Tampon.</p>
<p>当然，这种情况如今对女性而言可能适得其反，因为标准的 AFC（Average Frustrated Chump，即普通挫败者）反应往往是接受 LJBF（Let's Just Be Friends，即只做朋友）的拒绝，错误地希望通过成为完美的“替代男友”来“证明”自己值得她的亲近——满足她所有的关注和忠诚前提，却不期望她回报自己的亲近。我还要指出，这种情形类似于男性将女性当作“炮友”——满足他所有的性需求，却不期望对方回报以承诺。毋庸置疑，这只会将这位新“朋友”定位为冷漠的阿尔法男性（Alpha Male）的“情感支持”贝塔角色（Beta Counterpart），她会持续与之发生关系，然后抱怨——也就是俗称的“情感创可贴”。</p>
<p>The LJBF rejection also serves as an ego preservation for her in that having offered the false olive branch of ‘friendship’ to him in her rejection she can also sleep that night knowing that she (and any of her peers) wont think any less of herself. After all, she offered to be friends, right? She is absolved of any feelings of personal guilt or any responsibilities for his feelings if she still wants to remain amiable with him.</p>
<p>LJBF 拒绝对她而言也是一种自我保护，因为在拒绝中她以虚假的“友谊”橄榄枝向他示好，这使她能安心入睡，知道她（以及她的任何同龄人）不会因此看轻自己。毕竟，她提出要做朋友，对吧？如果她仍希望与他保持友好，她就能免除任何个人内疚感或对他情感的责任。</p>
<p>Men get a LJBF rejection because of a process. These are the “friends first” mindset guys; the guys who put far too much emphasis on a solitary woman and wait her out until the perfect moment to attempt to escalate to intimacy, at which point her most comfortable rejection (Buffer) is to LJBF. This is made all the more easy for her because of the process the guy used to get to that point.
男性因一种过程而遭遇 LJBF 拒绝。这些是持有“先做朋友”心态的男士；他们过分重视某一位女性，耐心等待至自认为合适的时机才试图推进亲密关系，而此时女性最感舒适的拒绝方式（缓冲）便是 LJBF。这一切对她而言更为容易，因为男性达到这一阶段所采用的过程。</p>
<p>Virtually all guys who get to the point of a LJBF rejection come to it because they fall in line with some variation of what I call a Sniper Mentality. They patiently wait for their one target, to the exception of all others, constantly attempting to prove their quality in doing so – meaning they emphasize a comfort level and try to be friends before lovers. In essence they believe that desexualizing themselves will make them more attractive (by virtue of not being like “other guys”) because they’ve bought into the idea that a woman must be comfortable with them first before they initiate intimacy. Once the AFC gets to a point where he’s mustered enough courage to initiate, and he feels she ‘should’ be comfortable enough to appreciate him as boyfriend material, the Sniper takes his shot.
几乎所有到达“让我们只做朋友”拒绝阶段的男性，都是因为他们遵循了我称之为“狙击手心态”的某种变体。他们耐心等待他们的唯一目标，排除所有其他可能，不断试图证明自己的品质——这意味着他们强调舒适感，试图先做朋友再做恋人。本质上，他们相信去性化自己会使他们更具吸引力（因为不像“其他男人”），因为他们接受了这样的观念：女性必须首先对他们感到舒适，然后才能开始亲密关系。一旦这位缺乏经验的男性鼓起勇气发起行动，并感觉她“应该”已经足够舒适，能够欣赏他作为男友的潜质时，狙击手便扣动了扳机。</p>
<p>The problem with this process is that it bypasses essential stages of attraction and the necessary discomfort and sexual tension necessary for intimacy and proceeds directly to a warm familiar, comfortable, (and ultimately anti-seductive) rapport, the exact opposite of arousal. If you think about this in terms of sex, this is the stage right after climax when she wants to cuddle, spoon and be wrapped up in her nice, secure oxytocin induced comfort. This is the opposite of the testosterone fueled, sweaty, anxious and uncomfortable stage of arousal and intercourse before that release. So in terms of “friendship” and the Sniper mentality, you’ve skipped arousal and gone straight to comfort. You’re perceived as a stuffed animal she can hug and then put back on the bed. Thus, when that previously platonic stuffed animal uncharacteristically gets a hard-on and says “I think we ought to be intimate” her reaction is to think that everything you’ve done for her up to that point has been a grand ruse. “My God, all you wanted was sex this whole time?”
这一过程的问题在于，它绕过了吸引的关键阶段以及亲密关系所需的必要不适和性紧张，直接进入了一种温暖、熟悉、舒适（最终反诱惑）的融洽关系，这与激发恰恰相反。如果从性的角度思考，这正是高潮后她想要依偎、拥抱并沉浸在由催产素带来的安全感中的阶段。这与之前由睾酮驱动、汗水淋漓、焦虑不安的激发和性交阶段形成鲜明对比。因此，在“友谊”和狙击手心态的语境下，你跳过了激发阶段，直接进入了舒适区。你被视为一个她可以拥抱然后放回床上的玩偶。因此，当那个原本纯真的玩偶出乎意料地勃起并说“我觉得我们应该亲密”时，她的反应是认为你之前为她所做的一切都是一场精心策划的骗局。“天哪，你一直想要的只是性吗？”</p>
<p>Her most predictable response is then the LJBF rejection. The field has already been tilled by you, it’s only one, very easy step for her to stay in that suspended comfort – “can’t we just be friends?” And then the cycle repeats. The AFC believes the LJBF is a genuine offer (not a rejection) and then falls back into the Sniper mentality. He mustn’t have been convincing enough to prove his worth to her and therefore returns to further proving himself as the perfect boyfriend until he once again presses his intent of intimacy after another period. All this goes on apace until she becomes intimate with a ‘real’ boyfriend and/or he acquires a new target after realizing his efforts with the LJBF girl aren’t bearing fruit.</p>
<p>她最可预见的反应便是 LJBF 拒绝。你已为她耕耘了这片田地，对她而言，停留在那种悬而未决的舒适中仅是一步之遥——“我们不能只做朋友吗？”随后，循环往复。AFC（挫男）误以为 LJBF 是真诚的提议（而非拒绝），于是重陷狙击手心态。他未能充分证明自己的价值，因此再次努力展现自己作为完美男友的形象，直到一段时间后再次表达亲密意图。这一切都在按部就班地进行，直到她与“真正”的男友发生亲密关系，或者他意识到对 LJBF 女孩的努力毫无成果后，转而寻找新的目标。</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of the ‘friend-zone’ advice women tend to offer is that they cast doubt on whether a LJBF rejection is in fact a rejection and not a genuine offer of friendship. To which I’ll say, the only reason the ‘friend-zone’ is such a common issue among men &amp; women for so long is because it’s been repeated so regularly and the outcome so predictable as a rejection. A woman’s behavior is always the only gauge of her intent, and thus when a rejection like LJBF has been so consistently met with the same outcome and behavior (as evidenced by thousands of identical stories from men) it’s only prudent for a Man to behave in kind.</p>
<p>许多女性倾向于提供的“朋友区”建议存在的问题在于，它们让人怀疑所谓的 LJBF 拒绝是否真的是拒绝，而非真诚的友谊邀请。对此，我要说，“朋友区”之所以成为男女间长期存在的普遍问题，正是因为它被反复提及，且结果如出一辙地被视为拒绝。女性的行为始终是她意图的唯一衡量标准，因此，当像 LJBF 这样的拒绝一再遭遇相同的结果和行为（如成千上万男性讲述的相同故事所示）时，男性采取相应的行为是明智之举。</p>
<p>A man’s default response should always be to excuse him from the LJBF situation. The reason for this is because it serves his best interest whether she is testing him or is rejecting him. If he is confident enough in himself to walk away from the sexually tense environment, he proves himself as decisive enough to put himself above being ‘played’ like this. Ergo, he leaves her with the impression that he is the PRIZE, possibly has contacts with better prospective women and is confident enough to take away his attentions from her and thus passes any shit test she might have implied, while placing the responsibility of a re-connection on her (where it should be anyway). If she has in fact had a change of heart (her prerogative, remember?) and is using the LJBF as a means to reject him, he still benefits from all of the above and plants the ‘seed of doubt’ in her about her initial estimation of his acceptability for her intimacy. And even if she is truly not interested in the guy, he walks away on his feet and not his knees, by playing “friend” with her and wasting still more time that could be far better spent with more productive prospects.
一个男人在面对“只是朋友”（LJBF）局面时，默认的反应应当始终是设法让自己从中解脱。这么做的原因在于，无论她是出于考验还是真的拒绝，这都符合他的最佳利益。如果他有足够的自信从这种充满性张力的环境中抽身，他便证明了自己有足够的决断力，能够超越被“玩弄”的境地。因此，他留给她的印象是他是个“奖品”，可能与更优秀的潜在女性有联系，并且有足够的自信将注意力从她身上移开，从而通过了她可能暗示的任何“测试”，同时将重新建立联系的责任置于她身上（这本应如此）。如果她确实改变了心意（记住，这是她的权利），并利用 LJBF 作为一种拒绝手段，他仍然从上述所有方面获益，并在她心中种下对她最初对他亲密接受度的“怀疑之种”。即使她真的对这位男士不感兴趣，他也能以朋友的身份与她相处，而不是浪费更多本可以与更有成效的潜在对象共度的时间，从而保持尊严地离开。</p>
<p>It is really one of the few win-win Game situations for a guy to make a wholesale withdrawal of his attentions when he is confronted with an LJBF. Women know all too well how an LJBF places social pressure on a guy to accept what basically amounts to an ultimatum of negative social proof, and that’s a hell of a shit test no matter what her real intent is. If the guy turns down her offer of friendship, he’s the dickhead, not her. But the guy that can do what common sense and gut instinct points out to him will be the one to succeed, with her, other women and himself.</p>
<p>面对 LJBF（Let's Just Be Friends，我们只做朋友）时，一个男人若能果断撤回他的关注，这确实是少数几项双赢的游戏局面之一。女性深知 LJBF 给男性带来的社交压力，它本质上是一种负面社交证明的最后通牒，无论她的真实意图如何，这都是一个极其棘手的考验。如果男性拒绝她的友谊提议，他便成了那个不识趣的人，而非她。然而，那些遵循常识和直觉行事的男人，将会在与她、其他女性以及自身的关系中取得成功。</p>
<p>Human being’s natural inclination is to avoid confrontation. When a man makes an approach to intimacy with a woman this becomes confrontational. If she is unsure of a man’s sexual acceptability for her intimacy she must resort to psycho-social, learned behaviors to diffuse this confrontation. Preferably these techniques should be reinforced beforehand and proven to diffuse just such a confrontation, thus the LJBF response is acted out through generations of women across many different cultures – quite simply it works more often than not. You can also apply this to the Boyfriend Disclaimer; women who not-so-nonchalantly weave into their casual conversation that they have a boyfriend in a preemptive effort to diffuse a potential suitor’s interests. It’s basically a proactive LJBF rejection.</p>
<p>人类的本能倾向是避免对抗。当男性向女性寻求亲密关系时，这种行为就具有了对抗性。如果女性对男性的性接受度存疑，她必须借助心理社会学上的习得行为来化解这种对抗。这些技巧最好事先得到强化并证明能有效化解此类对抗，因此，LJBF（Let's Just Be Friends，仅做朋友）的回应方式便在不同文化背景下的女性中代代相传——简而言之，它往往能奏效。同样，你也可以将此应用于“男友声明”；那些看似不经意间在闲聊中透露自己已有男友的女性，其实是在预先努力化解潜在追求者的兴趣。这本质上是一种主动的 LJBF 拒绝方式。</p>
<p>It’s the guy who is unwilling to accept these conventions that makes the most lasting impressions of confidence with women. It goes against what our common human heritage dictates for us – avoid conflict, don’t make waves, be her friend, etc. By not accepting a LJBF you emphatically make known that you are good at confrontation, you have an understanding of her motives and you’re confident enough in yourself to make it known. Not only does this impress her with potential for security provision it also implies future confidence. The problem for most guys is enacting this and making it a default behavior when our biology would have us move away from conflict rather than engage in an unacceptable social dynamic that is subtly damaging to his own interests.</p>
<p>正是那个不愿接受这些常规的男人，给女性留下了最持久的自信印象。这违背了我们共同的人类遗产所规定的——避免冲突、不要制造风波、成为她的朋友等。不接受“让我们做朋友”的态度，你明确地表明了自己擅长应对冲突，理解她的动机，并且有足够的自信去表明这一点。这不仅让她感受到你潜在的安全保障能力，还暗示了未来的自信。对大多数男人来说，问题在于如何实践这一点，并在我们的生物本能驱使我们远离冲突时，将其变为默认行为，而不是参与一种微妙地损害自身利益的不被接受的社会动态。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-honor-system"><a class="header" href="#the-honor-system">The Honor System</a></h1>
<p><em>“An unfamiliar feeling for one of you, but a horribly familiar feeling for the other.”</em></p>
<p>The concept of Honor that men began has been made to serve a feminine purpose. I have no doubt that the principle of honor dates back from as long ago as we can track human civilization, but like so many other social foundation Men have instituted, the feminine will covertly position them to their own purpose.
男性所开创的荣誉概念已被改造以适应女性的目的。我毫不怀疑荣誉原则可以追溯到我们所能追溯的人类文明之初，但就像许多其他由男性建立的社会基础一样，女性会巧妙地将它们重新定位以服务于自己的目的。</p>
<p>In the introduction to the Art of Seduction author Robert Greene explains why there was an original need for seduction to be developed into an art. For this we can look back to ancient civilizations where women were essentially a commodity. They had no OVERT external power to control their fates, but they excelled (and still do) at COVERT psychological internal power, and this of course finds a parallel in men and women’s preferred communication methods. The feminine’s primary agency has always been sexuality and manipulating influence by its means.
在《诱惑的艺术》引言中，作者罗伯特·格林阐述了为何最初需要将诱惑发展成一门艺术。我们可以回顾古代文明，那时女性实质上是一种商品。她们没有明显的外部力量来掌控自己的命运，但她们在隐秘的心理内在力量方面表现卓越（至今依然如此），当然这一点在男女偏好的沟通方式中也得到了体现。女性的主要手段一直是性魅力及其通过此手段施加的影响力。</p>
<p>Much in the same way that each gender communicates, so too is their method of interacting within their own gender. As Men we’re respected when we keep our word, sacrifice ourselves for a worthy cause (even to the point of disposability), solve problems rationally, our word is our bond, and a whole host of other qualifiers that make us respectable and worthy of integrity. We must be OVERT and above board; and when we encounter a man who is COVERT in his dealings we call him ‘shifty’ and think him untrustworthy. Even for the most noble of purposes, practicing the art of misdirection is not something men are respected for – at least not publicly.
与每种性别沟通的方式类似，他们在自己性别内部互动的方法也是如此。作为男性，当我们信守承诺、为有价值的事业牺牲自己（甚至到可牺牲的程度）、理性解决问题、言出必行，以及其他诸多品质使我们受人尊敬并值得信赖时，我们便赢得了尊重。我们必须公开透明、光明磊落；而当我们遇到一个在其事务中隐秘行事的男性时，我们会称他为“狡猾”，并认为他不可信赖。即便出于最高尚的目的，练习误导的艺术也不是男性所受尊敬的——至少在公开场合不是。</p>
<p>It’s just this overt masculine interactive nature that women are only too ready to exploit. In combination with their sexual agency and influence they use this overt male social interactive dynamic to position themselves in places where they can use indirect power. Cleopatra was an excellent example of this – sending armies to war by appealing to powerful men’s pride and honor, while reserving her sexuality as a reward. Virtually every Feminine Social Convention is rooted in appealing to, or attacking male social institutions – a dedication to an idealistic sense of honor being chief among them. The obvious example is of course “shaming” and the “do-the-right-thing” social contract.
正是这种显而易见的男性互动特质，女性们早已准备好加以利用。结合她们的性自主权与影响力，女性运用这种明显的男性社交互动动态，将自己置于能够运用间接权力的位置。克利奥帕特拉便是一个绝佳的例证——通过激发有权势男性的骄傲与荣誉感来派遣军队征战，同时将自身的性魅力保留为奖赏。几乎每一种女性社交惯例都植根于对男性社会机构的迎合或攻击，其中对理想化荣誉感的执着尤为突出。显而易见的例子当然包括“羞辱”和“做正确之事”的社会契约。</p>
<p>In fact to be a “Man” has become synonymous with living up to a feminine imperative that’s cleverly disguised as masculine Honor. It’s not that women created Honor, but rather that they’ve recreated it to serve their purpose. In the Biblical Ten Commandments we’re told not to commit adultery – don’t sleep with another man’s wife – which probably wasn’t too hard to abide by when polygamy was the norm. In fact multiple wives was a sign of affluence, it used to be the conspicuous consumption of the epoch. Why then is polygamy a social perversion now? What changes occurred that made polygamy honorable (even enviable) into a very evil taboo?
事实上，成为一个“男人”已变得与迎合一个巧妙伪装成男性荣誉的女性命令同义。并非女性创造了荣誉，而是她们重新塑造了它以适应自己的目的。在《圣经》的十诫中，我们被告诫不可犯奸淫——不可与他人的妻子同眠——这在多妻制盛行的时代或许并不难遵守。实际上，拥有多位妻子曾是财富的象征，它曾是那个时代显而易见的消费方式。那么，为何如今多妻制成了社会畸形现象？是什么变化使得原本光荣（甚至令人羡慕）的多妻制变成了极其恶劣的禁忌？</p>
<p>Along with language and culture, social conditions evolve. What we think of as Honorable today are the result of centuries molding. It’s very easy to romanticize about times when Honor among Men reigned supreme, and then lament the sad state of society today in comparison, but doing so is a fools errand. Honor in and of itself is, and should be, a foundation for Men, but it’s only useful when we understand it in the perspective of how it can be used against us.
与语言和文化一样，社会状况也在不断演变。我们今天所认为的荣誉，是历经数世纪塑造的结果。人们很容易对那个荣誉至上的时代心生浪漫情怀，然后对比当下社会的状况而感到悲哀，但这样做无异于徒劳无功。荣誉本身，且应当是男性的基石，但只有在我们从如何被其利用的角度理解它时，它才具有实际意义。</p>
<p>Man Up or Shut Up – The Male Catch 22
男人，要么坚强，要么闭嘴——男性的第二十二条军规</p>
<p>One of the primary way’s Honor is used against men is in the feminized perpetuation of traditionally masculine expectations when it’s convenient, while simultaneously expecting egalitarian gender parity when it’s convenient.
荣誉被用来对付男性的主要方式之一，是在方便时延续传统的男性期望，同时又在方便时要求性别平等。</p>
<p>For the past 60 years feminization has built in the perfect Catch 22 social convention for anything masculine; The expectation to assume the responsibilities of being a man (Man Up) while at the same time denigrating asserting masculinity as a positive (Shut Up). What ever aspect of maleness that serves the feminine purpose is a man’s masculine responsibility, yet any aspect that disagrees with feminine primacy is labeled Patriarchy and Misogyny.</p>
<p>过去 60 年间，女性化趋势在社会规范中构建了一个完美的自相矛盾的陷阱，针对一切男性特质；一方面期望男性承担起作为男人的责任（挺身而出），另一方面又贬低宣扬男性气概为积极品质的行为（闭嘴不言）。任何服务于女性目的的男性特质被视为男性的责任，然而任何与女性主导地位相悖的方面则被贴上父权制和厌女的标签。</p>
<p>Essentially, this convention keeps beta males in a perpetual state of chasing their own tails. Over the course of a lifetime they’re conditioned to believe that they’re cursed with masculinity (Patriarchy) yet are still responsible to ‘Man Up’ when it suits a feminine imperative. So it’s therefore unsurprising to see that half the men in western society believe women dominate the world (male powerlessness) while at the same time women complain of a lingering Patriarchy (female powerlessness) or at least sentiments of it. This is the Catch 22 writ large. The guy who does in fact Man Up is a chauvinist, misogynist, patriarch, but he still needs to man up when it’s convenient to meet the needs of a female imperative.</p>
<p>本质上，这一惯例让男性中的“贝塔男”陷入不断追逐自己尾巴的永恒循环。他们一生中被灌输的思想是，自己因男性气质（父权制）而受诅咒，但当符合女性主导需求时，仍需“挺身而出”。因此，西方社会中半数男性认为女性主宰世界（男性无力感），而与此同时，女性则抱怨父权制的持续影响（女性无力感）或至少有此感受，这便是那个著名的“第 22 条军规”的放大版。那个确实挺身而出的男人，被视为沙文主义者、厌恶女性者、父权主义者，但在满足女性主导需求时，他仍需适时地挺身而出。</p>
<p>In contemporary society we have a very different understanding of what Honor was, or was intended to be initially. One of the psychological undercurrents I see in most AFCs is a strong, self-righteous dedication to a very distorted conviction of Honor. A main tenet being an unearned, default respect for women; essentially an unearned Honor placed on a woman for no other reason than she’s female. We learn this (usually) from the time we’re children, “never hit a girl”. Naturally, this has only been ferociously encouraged by the feminine since Victorian times because it served a latent purpose right up until on demand (feminine exclusive) birth control was offered, and then prompted the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>在当代社会，我们对荣誉的含义或其最初意图有了截然不同的理解。在我观察到的大多数 AFC（平均失败者）中，一个显著的心理潜流是对荣誉的强烈、自以为是的执着，这种执着基于一种严重扭曲的信念。其主要信条之一是对女性的无条件、默认的尊重；本质上，这是一种无故赋予女性的荣誉，仅仅因为她是一名女性。我们通常从小就被灌输这种观念，“永远不要打女孩”。自然，自维多利亚时代以来，女性一直激烈地鼓励这一点，因为它一直服务于一个潜在目的，直到按需（女性独享）避孕措施的出现，随后引发了性革命。</p>
<p>Today, we still have women using the anachronism that is male Honor in a manner that serves their interests, but it’s contrasted with a sexually emphasized opportunism. A Man’s responsibility should be “Honoring” her as ‘the fairer sex’ while recognizing her ‘independence’. The AFC gobbles this stuff up and in an effort to better identify himself with her ideals he begins to convince himself that he’s unique in that he better exemplifies this false-virtue, this feminine defined sense of Honor than “other guys”.</p>
<p>如今，仍有女性利用过时的男性荣誉观念来谋取私利，但这种做法与强调性的机会主义形成鲜明对比。男性的责任应是“尊重”她作为“较温柔的性别”，同时承认她的“独立性”。AFC（Average Frustrated Chump，即普通挫败者）对此深信不疑，为了更好地认同她的理想，他开始说服自己，他在这方面比“其他男人”更能体现这种虚假的美德，这种由女性定义的荣誉感。</p>

<p>I read an article this morning about the 5 stages of grief (confronting death) and how they apply to coming into acceptance of a previously rejected truth. Yes, I know, there’s no end to the ridiculous interpretations of this played-out pop-psych list, but I was curious about how this might apply to an AFC coming to grips with unplugging from the Matrix, so I did a bit of searching and what did I find on my blog roll search but this:
今早我读了一篇文章，关于悲伤的五个阶段（面对死亡）以及它们如何适用于接受一个先前被拒绝的真相。是的，我知道，这个被过度使用的流行心理学列表有着无穷无尽的荒谬解读，但我好奇这如何适用于一个 AFC（平均普通男）面对从矩阵中解脱的现实，所以我做了一些搜索，结果在我的博客滚动搜索中发现了这个：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial</strong> – Still Plugged -In: “These game guys are a bunch of clowns, there’s no way this works on women. Women aren’t stupid. What a bunch of misogynists.” 否认 – 依然沉浸其中：“这些游戏玩家不过是一群小丑，绝不可能对女性起作用。女性并不愚蠢。真是群厌恶女性的人。”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anger</strong> – Post-Red Pill: “This is ridiculous! Why should I have to jump through all these hoops for women? I just want to be myself. Why couldn’t I have been a Natural Alpha®? I blame my parents/siblings/teachers/God/liberals/feminists/media/society, maybe George Sodini, Andres Breivik, James Holmes wasn’t so crazy after all.” 2. 愤怒 - 红丸后：“这太荒谬了！为什么我得为女人跳这么多圈套？我只想做我自己。为什么我就不能天生是个自然阿尔法男®呢？我怪我的父母/兄弟姐妹/老师/上帝/自由派/女权主义者/媒体/社会，也许乔治·索迪尼、安德斯·布雷维克、詹姆斯·霍姆斯也没那么疯狂。”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bargaining</strong> – Unplugged: “Well maybe it does have some good points…but, forget the hot girls, they’re way outta my league. I’ll give it a try if it can help me get around the bases with a plain Jane. Do I have to wear the fuzzy hat and black nail polish?” 3. 讨价还价——原声版：“嗯，或许它确实有些优点……不过，别提那些辣妹了，她们完全不是我的菜。如果它能帮我搞定一个普通女孩，我会试试的。我得戴那顶毛茸茸的帽子和涂黑色指甲油吗？”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depression</strong> – Bitter Taste of the Red Pill: “Wow, women really respond to this puffed-up act? And guys spend big bucks on it and wind up with more ass than a toilet seat? And I just joined up for this? The world is sad and so am I…” 4. 抑郁——红色药丸的苦涩滋味：“哇，女性真的对这种虚张声势的表演有反应吗？男人们为此大把花钱，结果得到的关注比马桶座还多？而我竟然加入了这个行列？世界是悲哀的，我也同样感到悲哀……”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong> – Game Awareness: “Maybe this IS the way things really work. I guess I should give up the gender relations mythology I’ve been holding onto…hey, what do you think of these negs I came up with?” 5. 接受——游戏意识：“也许这确实是事物运作的真正方式。我想我应该放弃我一直坚持的性别关系神话……嘿，你觉得我这些否定策略怎么样？”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jaded</strong> – MGTOW Permutations: “Fuck learning all these rules. Sex isn’t worth it and women aren’t that fun anyway. The last thing I want to do is learn routines or the 5 stages of pickup. There’s too many websites, too much to read, I can’t remember it all much less sort it all out. Who has all that time to go out and chat up women anyway? It’s not like I see any women under 40 at work at my engineering job to practice on. Video games and porn are more fun and more available. I just haffta look good and let the women come to me” 6. 疲惫* - MGTOW 的变奏：“去他妈的学习所有这些规则。性爱不值得，而且女人也没那么有趣。我最不想做的就是学习套路或搭讪的五个阶段。网站太多，要读的东西太多，我记不住也理不清。谁有那么多时间出去和女人搭讪呢？我在工程工作中也见不到 40 岁以下的女性来练习。电子游戏和色情片更有趣，也更易得。我只需要看起来不错，让女人来找我就行了。”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is a late addition to the list, hardly original and arguably relevant, but I added it for precautionary measures.</li>
<li>这是列表中的一个后期添加项，几乎不具原创性，且可能存在争议的相关性，但我出于预防措施考虑而将其加入。</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I get the predictable howls of “someone did this before you” (h/t Badger) allow me to put my spin on it. I get a ton of PMs from forum members, and read threads about guys with friends or relatives in, or just getting over, horrible relationships and how they’ve tried to unplug them only to run into stiff resistance. Looking at this process to acceptance it’s no wonder why.
在我听到那句可预见的“有人在你之前就这么做了”（感谢 Badger）之前，让我来谈谈我的看法。我收到了大量来自论坛成员的私信，也阅读了许多关于那些朋友或亲戚正处于，或刚刚走出糟糕关系的人的帖子，他们尝试帮助这些人摆脱困境，却遭遇了强烈的抵触。从接受这一过程的角度来看，这并不奇怪。</p>
<p>So my discussion question for today is this; how did you unplug? Was there some moment of clarity that opened your eyes? Did you go through a process like the one described here? Are you maybe still struggling with a certain phase?
那么，我今天想讨论的问题是：你是如何摆脱束缚的？是否有过某个让你豁然开朗的时刻？你是否经历了类似这里描述的过程？或许你仍在某个阶段苦苦挣扎？</p>

<p>A lot gets made of the Dark Triad or the Dark Side of Game where a skillful player can sadistically use his newly learned red-pill super powers for evil instead of for the greater good of mankind. Game-aware women – the ones who have been forcibly exhausted of all pretense of maintaing the illusion that Game is a lie – feel as though it’s owed to them, in their concession of Game’s reality, that Men should use Game to women’s benefit. Even to the last effort women still cling to the tools of a feminized acculturation;
关于黑暗三元组或游戏中的黑暗面，人们有很多讨论，其中技巧娴熟的玩家可能会残忍地运用其新掌握的红药丸超能力为恶，而非造福人类。那些深谙游戏之道的女性——她们已被迫耗尽所有维持游戏是谎言这一假象的伪装——感觉，既然她们承认了游戏的真实性，那么男性就应该利用游戏来造福女性。即便到了最后关头，女性依然紧握着女性化文化熏陶下的工具；</p>
<p>“Yeah, OK, you got us, Game is really what women want, hypergamy is the law of womankind, but now it’s your responsibility that you use it for the better benefit of society by molding a new breed of improved Betas to accommodate fem-centric monogamy. You owe us our security for having admitted to the grand illusion that’s kept you in thrall for so long.”
“是的，好吧，你抓住了我们，游戏确实是女性所追求的，高攀是女性的天性法则，但现在你有责任利用它为社会的更好利益服务，通过塑造新一代改良版的贝塔男性来适应女性中心的单配偶制。你欠我们一个保障，因为你承认了那个长久以来让你沉迷的宏大幻象。”</p>
<p>It’s an indictment of Game-aware women, and sympathizing men, that they should feel a need to delineate some aspects of Game into good camps (pro woman, pro feminized monogamy) and bad camps (manipulative, polygynous, male-centered). Even in the admission of the truth that Game has enlightened Men of, the feminine imperative still seeks to categorize the application of Game to its own end. That Men might have some means of access to their own sexual strategy is too terrible a Threat; Game must be colored good or bad as it concerns the imperatives of women and a fem-centric societal norm.
这是对游戏意识女性及同情男性的一种控诉，他们竟感到有必要将游戏的一些方面划分为好的阵营（亲女性、亲女性化一夫一妻制）和坏的阵营（操纵性、多妻制、男性中心）。即便在承认游戏所启迪男性的真相时，女性主导原则仍试图将游戏的应用归类为其自身目的。男性可能拥有一些获取自身性策略的手段，这一威胁太过可怕；游戏必须根据女性的主导原则和以女性为中心的社会规范被标定为好或坏。</p>
<p>As the default, socially correct and virtuous concern, women have an easier time of this. As Game becomes increasingly more difficult to deny or misdirect for the feminine, the natural next step in accepting it becomes qualifying its acceptable uses. While hypergamy is an ugly truth, the characterization of it becomes “just how women are” –an unfortunate legacy of their evolution. However for Men, the characterizations of the harsher aspects of Game in its rawest form  (contingencies for hypergamy) are dubbed “the dark arts”.
作为默认的、社会认可的美德关怀，女性在这方面相对容易应对。随着游戏对女性而言越来越难以否认或误导，接受它的自然下一步就是限定其可接受的用途。尽管择优婚配是一个丑陋的真相，但其特征被描述为“女性就是这样”——这是她们进化过程中不幸的遗产。然而对于男性来说，游戏中最严酷方面的原始形态（择优婚配的权宜之计）被冠以“黑暗艺术”的称号。</p>
<h2 id="myth-of-the-dark-arts"><a class="header" href="#myth-of-the-dark-arts">Myth of the Dark Arts</a></h2>
<p>黑魔法传说</p>
<p>According to common definition, the Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy, all of which are interpersonally aversive. Depending upon context, that may be a convenient assessment of a sociopathic personality, but it is hardly an accurate assessment of Game as a whole. In its desperation to come to terms with a more widespread acceptance of Game, the feminine imperative had to make some effort to disuade the common man (see Beta) from embracing the means to his release from the feminine Matrix. Associating Game with Dark Triad personality traits makes this qualification process much easier, since the feminine imperative owns the definition authority of what is social and what is anti-social.
根据普遍定义，黑暗三合一指的是三种人格特质：自恋、马基雅维利主义和精神病态，这些特质在人际关系中均具有排斥性。在特定情境下，这或许是对反社会人格的一种便捷评估，但远非对整个游戏策略的准确评价。为了应对游戏被更广泛接受的局面，女性主导原则不得不努力劝阻普通男性（如贝塔男）采纳解脱女性矩阵束缚的方法。将游戏与黑暗三合一的人格特质相联系，使得这一甄别过程变得容易许多，毕竟女性主导原则掌握着社会与反社会定义的权威。</p>
<p>The problem then becomes one of defining what acceptable use of Game is social and anti-social. Predictably Game-accepting women will want to cast Game into terms that suit them individually and accommodating for their own personal conditions as well as the priorities of their particular phase of life. However, because of such diverse conditions, consequently there is a lot of disagreement amongst Game-accepting women about what contextually constitutes appropriate use, thus a pick-and-pull form of rationalization about aspects of Game gets thrown about in their internal debates.
问题于是转化为界定游戏使用的社会性与反社会性。可以预见，接受游戏的女人们会倾向于将游戏解读为符合她们个人需求，并适应她们自身条件以及特定生活阶段优先级的概念。然而，由于这些条件的多样性，导致接受游戏的女人们之间对于何为情境下的恰当运用存在大量分歧，因此，她们内部争论中充斥着对游戏各方面进行选择性解读和拉扯的合理化过程。</p>
<p>For feminized men this is a very confusing debate. It’s difficult enough for them to accept that women love Jerks (despite being told the contrary for half their lives by women), but for the Game-accepting women they still think are ‘quality’ it’s a bitter pill to swallow when these women debate the aspects of acceptable, lovable Jerk-like qualities and the evil, user, manipulative, ‘dark art’ Jerk that only contextually misaligns with their present conditions and priorities. For both the plugged-in and the freshly unplugged this is an incongruency that they have a tough time reconciling against the ideals of moralism that a fem-centric society has unwittingly convinced them of.
对于女性化的男性来说，这场辩论非常令人困惑。他们已经很难接受女性喜欢“混蛋”这一事实（尽管半生以来一直被女性告知相反的情况），但对于那些他们仍认为是“优质”、接受“游戏”规则的女性来说，当这些女性讨论可接受的、可爱的“混蛋”特质与邪恶、利用、操纵的“黑暗艺术”混蛋之间的区别时，这种辩论无疑是一剂苦药。对于那些深陷其中或刚刚觉醒的人来说，这种不一致性让他们难以与道德主义理想相调和，而一个以女性为中心的社会无意中让他们深信这些理想。</p>
<p>While a broader understanding of hypergamy and Game make for useful tools for enlightened single men, the Game-accepting Beta plug-in will still see it strictly as a means to satisfying the female imperative – long-term provisional monogamy. Any deviation from this narrative, any guy using Game for personal gain, personal pleasure or to enact his own sexual strategy is guilty of crimes against (feminized) society. Since the societal Greater Good has been defined by the feminine imperative, anything counter to it is definitively evil, counterproductive, anti-social and manipulative sociopathy.
虽然对一妻多夫制和游戏策略的更广泛理解对开明的单身男性来说是实用的工具，但接受游戏观念的贝塔男仍会将其严格视为满足女性主导需求的手段——长期临时一夫一妻制。任何偏离这一叙事的行为，任何利用游戏策略谋取个人利益、个人享乐或实施自身性策略的男性，都被视为对（女性化）社会的犯罪。既然社会的大善已被女性主导需求所定义，那么与之相悖的一切无疑就是邪恶、反生产、反社会和操纵性的社会病态行为。</p>

<p>红色药丸的苦涩滋味</p>
<p>The truth will set you free, but it doesn’t make truth hurt any less, nor does it make truth any prettier, and it certainly doesn’t absolve you of the responsibilities that truth requires. One of the biggest obstacles guys face in unplugging is accepting the hard truths that Game forces upon them. Among these is bearing the burden of realizing what you’ve been conditioned to believe for so long were comfortable ideals and loving expectations are really liabilities. Call them lies if you want, but there’s a certain hopeless nihilism that accompanies categorizing what really amounts to a system that you are now cut away from. It is not that you’re hopeless, it’s that you lack the insight at this point to see that you can create hope in a new system – one in which you have more direct control over.</p>
<p>真相会让你自由，但它不会减轻真相带来的痛苦，也不会让真相变得更美好，更不会免除真相所要求的责任。在摆脱束缚的过程中，男性面临的最大障碍之一是接受游戏强加给他们的残酷真相。其中之一是承担起认识到长期以来你被灌输的所谓舒适理想和充满爱的期望实际上是负担的重担。如果你想称之为谎言，那就随你吧，但将这些实际上是你现在脱离的体系归类为谎言，会伴随着一种绝望的虚无主义。并非你无望，而是你此刻缺乏洞察力，看不到你可以在一个新体系中创造希望——一个你能更直接掌控的体系。</p>
<p>There are no “Dark Arts”, this is simply one last desperate effort of the feminine imperative to drag you back into the Matrix. There is only Game and the degree to which you accept it and are comfortable in using it in the context that YOU define. If that context is under the auspices of a mutually beneficial, mutually loving, mutually respecting LTR monogamy of YOUR choosing, know that it’s the fundaments of Game that are at the root of its success or failure. If that context is in terms of spinning multiple plates, liberating the affections of women from other men, and enjoying a love life based on your personal satisfactions, also understand that it lives and dies based on your understanding the fundaments of Game.</p>
<p>不存在所谓的“黑暗艺术”，这只是女性迫切需要的最后一次绝望尝试，试图将你拖回矩阵。只有游戏，以及你在多大程度上接受它并在你定义的情境中自如运用它。如果这个情境是在你选择的、互惠互利、互爱互敬的长期一夫一妻制关系下，要知道，游戏的基本原则是其成功或失败的根本。如果这个情境涉及同时维持多段关系、从其他男人那里解放女性的情感，并享受基于个人满足的爱情生活，同样要明白，它的存亡取决于你对游戏基本原则的理解。</p>
<p>Just as Alpha is not inherently nobel or deplorable, Game is neither inherently good nor evil – the Devil is in the details and whomever’s defined context in which you use it. In the introduction section of the 48 Laws of Power, author Robert Greene explains the same about power. Power is neither good nor evil, it simply is, and your capacity to use power, your comfort in using it, doesn’t invalidate the principles of power. Likewise, your discomfort or inability to accept those principles does not excuse you from the consequence of having that power used upon you.</p>
<p>正如 Alpha 本身并无高贵或可鄙之分，游戏亦非天生善恶——魔鬼藏在细节中，取决于你使用的定义情境。在《权力的 48 条法则》的引言部分，作者罗伯特·格林对权力进行了同样的阐述。权力本身并无善恶之分，它只是存在，而你运用权力的能力、使用它的舒适度，并不否定权力的原则。同样，你对这些原则的不适或无法接受，并不能使你免于权力施加于你的后果。</p>
<p>The unwritten, 49th Law of Power, is denying the utility of power itself, or demonizing its use both moralistically and socially. With the wide dispersion of Game theory this has been the reactionary tact of the feminine imperative; appeal to the deeply conditioned moral, ethical, honorable, virtuous ideals engrammatically planted in men by a fem-centric society, while redefining the acceptable use of the same Game the imperative demonizes for its own purposes.</p>
<p>未成文的第 49 条权力法则，即否认权力本身的实用性，或从道德和社会角度妖魔化其使用。随着博弈论的广泛传播，这种反应性策略已成为女性主导原则的应对手段；它诉诸于女性中心社会在男性心中根深蒂固的道德、伦理、荣誉和美德理想，同时为了自身目的重新定义博弈论的正当使用，而这一博弈论正是主导原则所妖魔化的。</p>

<p><em>Women get the men they deserve.</em>
<em>女人得到她们应得的男人</em>。</p>
<p>One point I try to make in my roaming about blogs dedicated to intergender dynamics is reading articles from many different perspectives. When I have the time, I actively hunt down articles that I know I will disagree with. I think it’s far too easy to get locked into the habit of seeking out bloggers, articles and statistics that reaffirm our own particular views. Even within the circles with which we’d be inclined to agree with there will often be a lot of conflicting viewpoints – such as the recent conflict pitting the MRAs vs. the PUAs, or Game vs. MGTOW.
在我游走于探讨两性动态的博客时，我努力做到的一点是从多种不同视角阅读文章。如果有空闲，我会积极寻找那些我知道自己会持异议的文章。我认为，人们很容易养成只寻找那些强化我们个人观点的博主、文章和统计数据的习惯。即便在我们倾向于认同的圈子里，也常常存在许多相互冲突的观点，比如最近的冲突，即男性权益活动者（MRAs）与搭讪艺术家（PUAs）之间的对立，或是游戏理论（Game）与男性走自己的路（MGTOW）之间的争论。</p>
<p>I began this blog with the intent of studying the reasons why intergender social and psychological dynamics evolve, what functions they serve, and develop contingencies or actionable methods of bettering one’s life using this information – really this is the core of Game. The problem inherent in this, and really unplugging in general, is that it often comes with a healthy dose of disillusionment. Once you strip away the heady fantasies of soul-mates and expectations of ‘happily ever afters”, and replace it with a more practical understanding based on reasonably reliable, empirical explanations, what you’re left with looks a lot like nihilism. Even for the most staunch realists among the ‘community’ there’s still a desire to want to apply, however slightly, some kind of mysticism to the process of connecting with another human being. With other Men it may be some esoteric desire to cast their association in terms of honor, integrity or respect – with women it comes as idealization or predestination.
我开设此博客的初衷，是探究两性间社会与心理动态演变的原因，它们所承载的功能，并基于这些认识发展出改善生活的策略或可操作的方法——这实际上是“游戏”的核心所在。然而，这一探索过程及其普遍的“觉醒”现象，往往伴随着一定程度的幻灭感。一旦剥离了灵魂伴侣的迷思和“从此幸福生活”的期待，取而代之的是基于合理可靠实证解释的务实理解，所剩下的便颇具虚无主义色彩。即便在“社群”中最坚定的现实主义者，也难免怀揣一丝将某种神秘主义融入与他人连接过程的渴望。对于男性而言，或许是某种深奥的荣誉、正直或尊重的追求；而对女性来说，则表现为理想化或宿命论的倾向。</p>
<p>I’m not saying this desire to spiritualize these connections is without merit, but I can’t help but see the conflict it has in coexisting with the practicality of what we’re learning about ourselves. Just in the last 30 years we’ve come to understand the biochemical natures of our emotions. We know a hormone like oxytocin induces feelings of trust and promotes nurturing. We know that the endorphin / dopamine profile associated with feelings of infatuation, lust and love is chemically similar to that of heroine. Poof! There goes the magic. We have an understanding of women’s ovulatory cycles and the resulting sexual behavioral habits that are induced by them. Only the generations of the late 20th and 21st are privy to this information. Evo-Psychology has only risen to prominence as a field of study in the past 15 years.
我并非认为这种将人际关系精神化的愿望毫无价值，但我无法忽视它与我们对自己实际认知的现实性之间的冲突。仅在过去 30 年间，我们就已深入理解了情绪的生物化学本质。我们知道，像催产素这样的激素能引发信任感并促进关怀行为。我们也了解到，与迷恋、欲望和爱情相关的内啡肽/多巴胺模式在化学上与海洛因相似。瞧，魔法就这样消失了。我们对女性的排卵周期及其引发的性行为习惯有了深入了解。只有 20 世纪末和 21 世纪的这几代人掌握这些知识。进化心理学作为一门学科，仅在过去的 15 年里才崭露头角。</p>
<p>Discomfort and Disillusion
不适与幻灭</p>
<p>All of this makes for some very uncomfortable realizations, particularly when men become aware of the social schemas established to keep them in a female-centric reality. Game is a recent countermeasure developed by men to better adapt to this feminine primacy, but it was only possible through advances in both communication technologies, access to globalized information and new socio-psychological theory. Prior to these advancements, and with the rise of feminization from the late 60s to the late 90s men were clueless as to their social predicament. From the start of the sexual revolution until the beginning of this millennia, western masculinity (and femininity) has been subjected to the greatest deliberate social and psychological restructuring, any generation has ever known. And I shouldn’t limit that exclusively to western culture; now we see this effect filtering into Asia, Japan, even traditionally masculine Latin cultures. As westernization spreads, so too does it’s feminization.
这一切都带来了一些令人不安的认知，尤其是当男性意识到那些为了维持以女性为中心的现实而建立的社会模式时。游戏是男性近期发展出的一种对策，旨在更好地适应这种女性主导地位，但这一对策的实现得益于通信技术的进步、全球化信息的获取以及新的社会心理学理论。在此之前，从 60 年代末到 90 年代末，随着女性化趋势的上升，男性对于自身的社会困境一无所知。从性革命开始到本世纪初，西方男性气质（及女性气质）经历了前所未有的有意识的社会和心理重构。我并不应将此局限于西方文化；如今，这一影响正逐渐渗透到亚洲、日本，甚至传统上以男性为主导的拉丁文化中。随着西方化的扩散，其女性化特征也随之蔓延。</p>
<p>What have men been left clinging to? The pseudo-guilt we’ve been taught to be ashamed of as part of our past “patriarchy” to be sure, but more importantly we were left with the vestiges of that magical thinking. In the face of a yet undefined hypergamy, we wanted to still believe in the ‘Sugar &amp; Spice’ myth, the respect her wishes motive, the marriage goal – all of which were (are) still actively reinforced by a feminine imperative that knew its time had come and men were too stupid in their romanticism to know it. That is until the Meta Game was established.
男人们被留住了什么？我们被教导要为过去的“父权制”所伴随的虚假罪恶感感到羞愧，但更重要的是，我们保留了那种神奇思维的痕迹。面对尚未明确定义的超婚配，我们仍想相信“糖与香料”的神话，尊重她的愿望的动机，婚姻的目标——所有这些仍被一个女性主导的意识形态积极强化，它知道自己的时代已经到来，而男人们太愚蠢，沉迷于浪漫之中，无法察觉。直到元游戏的确立，这一切才发生了变化。</p>
<p>The great and powerful Oz that was feminization is finally having the curtain pulled back on it. In this new age of communication men can globally “share notes” and come to their own conclusions – and women shriek all the louder as we hit closer to the truth. Thanks to its relative anonymity, no longer is there any social stigma to fear from even broaching the subject of how best to deal with women. The great wailing we hear and read from women is less about current social implications and more about having the 30 year social program of feminization being exposed for what it truly was. Yet even in the face of men seeing the Empress with no clothes, they still make appeals to the romantic, magical association men clung to before they became aware of a hypergamy enabling feminization. We read cries of Man-Up! Accept your previous responsibilities of being a husband and leader, but don’t be overbearing and crush our spirits. And in the back row a new generation of women, the 22 year olds, scream “where’s the party?” as they upload a fresh set of nudes shot in the bathroom from their cell phones.
那个曾经伟大而强大的女性化奥兹终于被揭开了帷幕。在这个新的交流时代，男性可以全球“分享笔记”并得出自己的结论——而随着我们越来越接近真相，女性们的尖叫声也愈发响亮。多亏了相对的匿名性，现在甚至触及如何最好地应对女性的主题也不再有任何社会污名需要畏惧。我们听到和读到的女性的巨大哀嚎，与其说是关于当前的社会影响，不如说是关于长达 30 年的女性化社会计划被揭露其真实面目。然而，即使面对男性看到赤裸裸的皇后，他们仍然诉诸于男性在意识到助长女性化的超婚主义之前所依附的浪漫、神奇的联想。我们听到“振作起来！接受你作为丈夫和领导者的先前责任，但不要过于强势，压垮我们的精神”的呼声。而在后排，新一代女性，那些 22 岁的女孩们，尖叫着“派对在哪里？”同时从手机上传着在浴室里新拍的一组裸照。</p>
<p>Women get the men they deserve. For all the crowing and publicity of feminine triumphalism, there’s still a wonderment at why men are increasingly less and less motivated to play along in their feminine reality. As tough as it is for men to disabuse themselves of their romanticism, it’s even more so for women to accept their own natures in the shadow of the experiment that was 20th century feminization. They’re reaping the whirlwind that the Matriarchy of the sexual revolution has sown. It’s all the more ironic to read the same mothers who created this generation of men lament how their daughters are unmarried and childless at 35.
女性得到她们应得的男性。尽管女性胜利主义的喧嚣与宣传不绝于耳，人们仍不禁疑惑为何男性越来越不愿参与她们构建的女性现实。对男性而言，摆脱浪漫主义的束缚固然艰难，但女性在 20 世纪女性化实验的阴影下接受自身本性则更为不易。她们正承受着性革命母权制所播下的风暴。更具讽刺意味的是，那些塑造了这一代男性的母亲们，如今却在哀叹她们 35 岁的女儿们未婚无子。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compensation"><a class="header" href="#compensation">Compensation</a></h1>
<p>One of the higher orders of physical standards women hold for men is height. There are countless threads in the community that address this, but I think that for the better part it’s not difficult to observe this in the ‘real world’. I should also add that this is one characteristic that is central to the Social Matching Theory in that human’s are sensitive to asymmetrics and imbalances.</p>
<p>女性对男性身体标准中较高的一项是身高。社区中有无数帖子讨论这一点，但我认为，在“现实世界”中，这一点不难观察到。我还应补充，这是社会匹配理论的核心特征之一，因为人类对不对称和不平衡非常敏感。</p>
<p>Now, before I get told in so many ways that this isn’t always the case or the “not all girls are like that” exceptions to the rule, let me start by saying that this isn’t the point of this thread. I don’t want to debate the logistics of why women prefer a taller mate or the tendency for like to attract like in this respect. No, what I’m on about is really the root of the infamous “short man’s disease.” That’s right, you know who I’m talking about; the ultimate in compensation for inferiority, the dreaded ‘short man’s disease.’ You know the guy. About 5′ 6″, pounding out the weight on the bench press. Bad ass attitude, hangs with the bigger guys (which is pretty much all of them) and throws his ego around. What a tool, right?
现在，在我被各种方式告知这并非总是如此，或者被提醒“并非所有女孩都那样”的例外情况之前，请允许我先声明，这并非本帖的主旨。我不想争论为何女性偏爱更高大的伴侣，也不想探讨在这一方面相似相吸的倾向。不，我关注的是那个臭名昭著的“矮个男病”的根源。没错，你们知道我在说谁；这是对自卑感的终极补偿，令人闻风丧胆的“矮个男病”。你肯定认识这种人。大约 5 英尺 6 英寸高，在卧推器上拼命举重。态度嚣张，与更高大的家伙们混在一起（基本上是所有人），四处炫耀他的自尊。真是个工具，对吧？</p>
<p>But if you think this is only limited to short men (or women), you’re making a mistake. You see, in so many ways we all compensate for deficiencies. I recently read a thread on another “non-community” forum that saw fit to start a topic asking why men lie and it got me to thinking why any of us lie, man or woman. I’ve also been fielding a lot of questions regarding issues we kind of take for granted after having discussed them to death in the manosphere; one of those being the nature of personality and one’s ability to change their own or have it changed by circumstance, or often both. I think it’s a tragic miscalculation on our part to think of personality as static, unchangeable or to question the ingenuousness of that change, but more tragic is the doubting ourselves for that change.
但如果你认为这仅限于矮个子男性（或女性），那你就错了。你看，在许多方面，我们都在弥补自身的不足。最近，我在另一个“非社区”论坛上读到一条帖子，该论坛认为有必要开启一个话题，探讨男性为何撒谎，这让我思考起我们任何人，无论男女，为何会撒谎。同时，我也收到了许多关于一些议题的提问，这些议题在男性圈子里已被反复讨论到几乎成为共识；其中之一便是性格的本质以及个体是否有能力改变自己的性格，或受环境影响而改变，又或两者兼而有之。我认为，将性格视为静止不变或质疑这种改变的真诚性，是我们的一种悲剧性误判，但更可悲的是，我们因这种改变而自我怀疑。</p>
<p>One simple truism that a lot of people love to use as their convenient escape clause is the JBY (just be yourself) notion. This of course is just what ones says as advice when they really don’t know what else to say. Given that though, what is it that makes a personality shift ‘genuine’. Any number of us probably know an individual who began acting differently at some point in their life. This can be the result of some kind of tragedy or trauma (think PTSD) or it can be that the individual felt a need to change their fundamental way of thinking and made the change of their own accord. Usually in these cases we think of them as posers or try-hards, trying to be something they’re not. They reflect this change in their appearance, their regular practices, their friends or the people they associate with, attitudes, behaviors etc. And this is what’s jarring for people who knew their prior personality.
一个许多人喜欢用作方便的免责条款的简单真理是“JBY（做你自己）”的概念。当然，这只是在他们真的不知道该说什么时给出的建议。然而，是什么让一个人格转变显得“真实”呢？我们中许多人可能认识某个在生命中的某个时刻开始表现得不同的人。这可能是某种悲剧或创伤（如 PTSD）的结果，或者是个体感到需要改变他们基本的思维方式，并自愿做出改变。通常在这些情况下，我们认为他们是装模作样或过分努力，试图成为他们不是的那种人。他们在外表、日常习惯、朋友或交往的人、态度、行为等方面反映出这种变化。这对那些了解他们之前性格的人来说是令人震惊的。</p>
<p>From the 48 Laws of Power:
来自《权力的 48 条法则》：</p>
<p><em>Law 17: Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability</em>
<em>法则 17：保持他人悬而未决的恐惧：培养一种不可预测的氛围</em></p>
<p><em>Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.</em></p>
<p><em>人类是习惯的生物，对在他人行为中寻找熟悉感有着难以满足的需求。你的可预测性给予他们一种掌控感。反过来：刻意变得不可预测。看似缺乏一致性或目的性的行为将使他们失去平衡，他们会因试图解读你的举动而精疲力尽。极端运用此策略，甚至能产生威慑与恐吓的效果。</em></p>
<p>What makes us doubt the sincerity of a personal change is what’s at issue. If their change is something we agree with or generally think of as positive, we are less inclined to doubt the ingenuousness of this change. But when their change conflicts with our own interests, when it dramatically clashes with what we’ve come to expect of that individual, this is where we doubt their sincerity. We say “dude, stop trying to be something you’re not”, we tear it down, we fall back on JBY platitudes because it clashes with our interpretations. And in this doubt, we fish for reasons as to why a person would want that change; essentially, what are they compensating for? It may be funny to presume someone driving a monster truck down the highway is making up for a small penis, but the root of that ‘compensating’ is what makes us feel uncomfortable in our own internal compensating.</p>
<p>是什么让我们怀疑一个人改变的真诚性，这才是问题的关键。如果他们的改变是我们认同的，或普遍认为是积极的，我们就不太会质疑这种改变的真诚度。但当他们的改变与我们的利益相冲突，当它与我们对该个体的预期发生剧烈冲突时，我们便开始怀疑其真诚性。我们会说：“伙计，别再试图成为你不是的那种人。”我们否定它，我们回归那些陈词滥调，因为这与我们的理解相悖。在这种怀疑中，我们寻找一个人为何想要这种改变的原因；本质上，他们在弥补什么？假设某人开着巨型卡车在高速公路上行驶是为了弥补小尺寸的不足，这或许显得滑稽，但这种“弥补”的根源正是让我们在自己内心的弥补中感到不适的原因。</p>
<p>It’s a difficult enough task for an individual to critically assess their own personality, and even more so to effect a change in it, but the final insult is to have other’s doubt the veracity of it. What others fail to see is that at some point in the development of their own personalities, they themselves had to compensate for deficiencies, discontentments and prompts to grow and mature. This is a gigantic hurdle for most AFCs wanting to transition to being something more. On SoSuave we’ve always called that being a DJ (Don Juan), but that doesn’t encompass the entirety of maturing. I like the term positive masculinity, but the crux of all that is the ingenuousness of the actual change. Why are you changing?</p>
<p>对于个人而言，批判性地评估自己的性格本就是一项艰巨的任务，更遑论要对其进行改变，但最令人沮丧的是，他人竟质疑这一改变的真实性。他人往往忽视了一点：在自身性格发展的某个阶段，他们也曾不得不弥补缺陷、化解不满并响应成长的号召，以走向成熟。对于大多数渴望从“永远的失败者”（AFC）转变为更优秀存在的人来说，这是一个巨大的障碍。在 SoSuave 论坛上，我们常称之为成为“唐璜”（Don Juan），但这并不涵盖成熟的全部内涵。我倾向于使用“积极阳刚”这一术语，但这一切的核心在于实际改变的真诚性。你为何要改变？</p>
<p>There is a saying that AFCs are like a bunch of crabs in a barrel. As soon as one is about to climb out there are always half a dozen ready to pull him back in again. Add to this a self-doubt from societal conditionings that tell him to stay the same, not to aspire to more, he’s doing it right, and it’s amazing that any AFC becomes a DJ. This has been termed the ‘Societal Cockblock’; they tell him he’s compensating, and in a way they’re right, but for the wrong reason. PUA skills, DJ psychology, Positive Masculinity are all compensations for deficiencies. They go beyond behavior modification – that’s the easy answer. PUAs teach a set of behaviors and scripts to be aped in order to mask a deficit. These are easy pickings for the JBY apologists because they are actions that generally don’t match a person’s prior personality. They’re not “really” like that, so they’re posers, or worse, they’ve been duped by guys hawking the PUA brand of self-help tools. What they don’t see is the genuine desire to change and the reasons for it.</p>
<p>有句俗语说，AFC 们就像一桶螃蟹，每当有一只快要爬出去时，总会有半打准备把它拉回来。再加上社会条件作用下的自我怀疑，告诉他要保持现状，不要追求更多，他做得对，令人惊讶的是，任何 AFC 能成为 DJ。这被称为“社会阻挠”；他们告诉他这是在补偿，某种程度上他们没错，但出于错误的原因。PUA 技巧、DJ 心理、积极阳刚之气都是对缺陷的补偿。它们超越了行为修正——那是简单的答案。PUA 教导一套行为和剧本供模仿，以掩盖不足。这对 JBY 辩护者来说是容易攻击的目标，因为这些行为通常与一个人先前的个性不符。他们“不是真的”那样，所以他们是装模作样，或者更糟，被兜售 PUA 自我提升工具的家伙欺骗了。他们没看到的是真正想要改变的愿望及其原因。</p>
<p>When we compensate, we improvise, we fake it till we make it; but who determines when we’ve stopped faking it? We do. I read all kinds of articles doubting the realized capacity a person has to adopt ‘natural Game’ into their personality. It’s an internalization process for sure, but there has to come a point of transition where a Man’s default response IS his Game response. That’s who he IS now.
当我们补偿时，我们即兴发挥，我们假装直到成功；但谁来决定我们何时不再假装？我们自己。我阅读了各种质疑一个人将“自然游戏”融入其个性的实现能力的文章。这无疑是一个内化过程，但必须有一个过渡点，即一个人的默认反应就是他的游戏反应。这就是他现在的样子。</p>

<p><em>“Self-love is not so great a sin as self-neglect." – Henry V</em>
<em>“自爱并不如自我忽视那般罪恶深重。——亨利五世”</em></p>
<p>Pride is one thing that people get very confused about. It’s a healthy thing to have pride of oneself, to be proud of our accomplishments; it’s a very real source of self-confidence. Humility is an admirable quality, don’t get me wrong, but humility is only genuine when you’re confident of your own abilities. It takes a humble Man to walk away from a fight that he knows he could win, but chooses not to engage in. Generally humility is only self-gratifying, because only rarely will others appreciate it as humility (those familiar with your abilities) and not view it as cowardice, or at best a lack of confidence. Pride often appears arrogant because people of lesser accomplishments become envious, and people of better accomplishments think less of them than you do. It’s very important not to appear too perfect, but it’s equally important not to seem spineless.</p>
<p>骄傲是人们常常感到困惑的一个概念。拥有自我骄傲，为自己的成就感到自豪，是一种健康的心态，也是自信的真正源泉。谦虚固然是一种令人钦佩的品质，但请不要误解，只有当你对自己的能力有信心时，谦虚才是真实的。一个谦逊的人会从一场明知能赢却选择不参与的战斗中走开。通常，谦虚只是自我满足，因为很少有人会真正欣赏这种谦虚（那些了解你能力的人），而不会将其视为懦弱，或顶多是缺乏自信。骄傲常常显得傲慢，因为成就较低的人会心生嫉妒，而成就较高的人则认为他们不如你。非常重要的一点是不要显得过于完美，但同样重要的是不要显得软弱无骨。</p>
<p>It’s quite another thing to be “prideful”and this is where the disconnect comes for a lot of AFCs, particularly ones with strong ego-investments in morality, chivalry, honor, etc. My old AFC self used to struggle with this as well. The AFC sublimates himself; he self-deprecates because he believes, erroneously, that this ideology will separate him from the herd, make him “not-like-other-guys”. He mistakenly believes that he’s unique in this when actually he’s in the majority. Why? For the answer all you need do is look at the most common threads from guys just recently discovering the community.</p>
<p>“骄傲”是另一回事，而这正是许多 AFC（平均挫男）感到困惑的地方，尤其是那些在道德、骑士精神、荣誉等方面有强烈自我投入的人。我曾经的 AFC 自我也曾为此挣扎。AFC 会自我升华；他自我贬低，因为他错误地认为这种理念能让他与众不同，使他“不像其他男人”。他误以为自己在这方面是独特的，实际上他属于大多数。为什么呢？要找到答案，你只需看看那些刚刚发现这个社区的男人们最常见的帖子。</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there are some guys who go from zero to PUA and then parley that into some kind of seducer-hood. I would also argue that they are the rare exceptions. Guys don’t search out community forums or blogs like this because they’re getting too much pussy. They search it out because what they’ve been doing isn’t producing the results they want. When you think about this, they’ve been doing exactly what others criticize Game for – they’re working from a script. We like to point out the flaws in autonomously adhering to a script with regards to PUA techniques; you become a social robot, not “yourself”. But from an opposite side, what you’re doing now, or have done, as an AFC (Beta Game) is equally as scripted. The only difference, and far more insidious, is that they’ve internalized these AFC “scripts” that society on whole has conditioned into them as personal investments over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p>我毫不怀疑，有些家伙从零基础迅速成为 PUA 高手，并借此跻身某种诱惑者的行列。我也认为他们是少数例外。男人们并非因为性事过多而寻求社区论坛或此类博客，他们之所以搜索这些资源，是因为他们以往的做法并未带来期望的结果。细想之下，他们正是在做其他人批评“游戏”时所指出的行为——他们遵循着一套剧本行事。我们乐于指出，在 PUA 技巧上机械地遵循剧本的缺陷：你会变成一个社交机器人，而非真实的“自我”。但从另一个角度看，你现在所做或曾经作为 AFC（即 Beta 游戏玩家）的行为，同样也是按剧本行事。唯一的区别，且更为隐蔽的是，他们将这些社会整体长期灌输给他们的 AFC“剧本”内化为自己的一生投资。</p>
<p>After dropping your AFC mindset for a one based on self-interest, what happened? You probably began to see results. You can hook up with women the calibre of which were previously unavailable to you before, and all it took was replacing your chump behavior and mentality with one of self-concern and self-priority. You might’ve felt like an asshole, people may have said you’ve changed or become bitter, or you’re being someone you’re not, but you couldn’t argue with the results.</p>
<p>在摒弃了以他人为中心的心态，转而以自我利益为导向后，发生了什么？你很可能开始看到了成效。你能与之前无法企及的高质量女性建立联系，所需要的只是将懦弱的行为和心态转变为自我关注和自我优先。你或许会觉得自己像个混蛋，人们可能会说你变了，变得刻薄，或者你正在变成另一个人，但你无法否认这些成果。</p>
<p>One of the biggest dangers of the PUA ideal is that it does nothing to address the root problem of AFCism (for lack of a better term). AFCs don’t want to stop being AFCs. Largely, they just want their ONEitis (or their “dream girl”) to hook up with them long term and then drift back into a comfortable ‘just being themselves’. According to The Game even Mystery, with all his PUA prowess, degenerates into a simpering, borderline suicidal chump when he realizes that his PUA scripts do nothing in an LTR with Katya (his ONEitis). The most notorious PUA in modern history was still an AFC, because he hadn’t killed that mentality, that AFC internalization – he hadn’t killed his inner AFC.</p>
<p>PUA 理念最大的危险之一在于，它并未触及 AFC 主义（暂且如此称呼）的根本问题。AFC 们并不想停止成为 AFC。很大程度上，他们只是希望自己的“唯一”（或“梦中情人”）能与他们长期交往，然后他们便可以回归到那种舒适的“做回自己”的状态。根据《游戏》一书所述，即便如 Mystery 这般拥有高超 PUA 技巧的人物，在意识到自己的 PUA 剧本在长期关系中对 Katya（他的“唯一”）毫无作用时，也沦为了一个近乎自杀边缘的懦弱者。这位现代史上最臭名昭著的 PUA，依然是一个 AFC，因为他没有根除那种心态，那种内化的 AFC 思维——他未能消灭内心的 AFC。</p>
<p>Another very common occurrence is the “reformed” AFC who makes progress toward becoming more Game savvy, and as a result gets his “dream girl”, only to lose her after reverting back into an AFC frame once he’s in an LTR with her. I’m not a big Ross Jefferies fan, but he did say something very profound once, he said “teaching PUA skills to these chumps is like giving dynamite to children.” This is probably truer than he realized, because the potential for disaster is much higher. Most guys want that silver bullet, the magic formula that will get them the girl, but it does nothing to prepare them for the idyllic LTR their beta nature has fantasized about for so very long. They don’t become Men, they become children with dynamite. So are we really surprised when the guy who finally gets his Dream Girl as a result of learning Game becomes despondent and suicidal when he loses the “best thing he’ll ever have” when she leaves him? Are we shocked when his ONEitis turns out to be a BPD girl and his life’s ambitions fall into a death-spiral because he was unprepared to deal with a post-Game LTR?</p>
<p>另一种常见情况是，那位“改过自新”的 AFC（失恋挫男）在向着更懂游戏的境界迈进，并因此赢得“梦中情人”，却在进入长期关系（LTR）后重蹈 AFC 覆辙，最终失去她。我虽非罗斯·杰弗里斯（Ross Jefferies）的拥趸，但他曾言一句颇为深刻：“向这些蠢蛋传授 PUA 技巧，无异于将炸药交给孩童。”此言或许比他所意识到的更为真切，因为潜在的灾难性后果风险更高。多数男性渴望那颗银弹，那个能助他们赢得佳人的神奇公式，但这并未让他们为长久以来由其贝塔（顺从）本性所幻想的田园诗般 LTR 做好准备。他们未成为真正的男人，反倒成了手持炸药的孩童。因此，当一个通过学习游戏技巧终于赢得梦中情人的男子，在失去“此生至爱”后变得绝望乃至有自杀倾向时，我们真的感到惊讶吗？当他的唯一执念对象实为一位边缘型人格障碍（BPD）女孩，而他的人生志向因未能应对游戏后的 LTR 而陷入死亡螺旋时，我们又何以震惊？</p>
<p>The problem with just employing PUA skills to get any woman is that sometimes it actually gets you ANY woman. There’s no vetting process, no discernment, taught as part of technique. AFCs get so impressed with their new found PUA confidence and getting hotter women, getting their old friend-zone girl interested, or getting women at all, that they have no motivation to think about who they should get involved with. They’re unprepared for emotionally manipulative women, and particularly when they’re more attractive than anything they’d ever had before. They obsess. They predictably get ONEitis, but they develop a ONEitis and in such an extreme case they can be suicidal about a woman they’d previously never been able to attain.</p>
<p>仅仅运用 PUA 技巧去追求任何女性存在的问题在于，有时这真的会让你得到任何女性。这里没有筛选过程，没有辨识能力的培养，这些都未被纳入技巧教学中。普通男性（AFCs）对于他们新获得的 PUA 自信以及能够吸引更迷人的女性、让曾经的朋友区女孩产生兴趣，或是能够吸引到女性本身，感到如此兴奋，以至于他们没有动力去思考应该与谁建立关系。他们对于情感操控型的女性毫无准备，尤其是当这些女性比他们以往所拥有的任何人都更具吸引力时。他们会沉迷其中，可预见地陷入“唯一病”（ONEitis），但在这种极端情况下，他们可能会对一个原本无法企及的女性产生自杀倾向。</p>
<p>PUA skills are tools, and valuable ones at that, but adopting a positive masculine mindset prepares an AFC for more. An AFC needs to divorce himself from deep set social and psychological schemas – he needs to unlearn the self-delusions that a lifetime has conditioned him to internalize into his personality. Giving an AFC Game skills before this transition will only condemn him to disappointment and despair in an LTR. The more important lesson is learned in the discarding of that old, beta, way of thinking, while understanding the tools and techniques to apply the new, confident, positive masculine mindset.</p>
<p>PUA 技巧是工具，且是宝贵的工具，但培养积极的男性心态为 AFC（平均挫男）准备了更多。AFC 需要从根深蒂固的社会和心理模式中解脱出来——他必须摒弃一生中被训练内化到性格中的自我欺骗。在转变之前传授 AFC 游戏技能只会让他陷入长期关系中的失望与绝望。更重要的教训在于摒弃旧有的、顺从的思维方式，同时理解并运用新工具和技术来培养自信、积极的男性心态。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="appreciation"><a class="header" href="#appreciation">Appreciation</a></h1>
<p>I’ve had a fantastic marriage for over 15 years now, but I’m not going to sugar coat the facts that marriage involves life changing sacrifices for men that no woman will ever fully understand or appreciate. I’m not anti-marriage. I’m anti- uninformed, pollyanna, shoulda’-saw-it-coming, ONEitis fueled, shame induced, bound for bankruptcy, scarred my children for life, marriage.
我拥有一段长达 15 年的美妙婚姻，但我不会粉饰事实，即婚姻对男性意味着改变生活的牺牲，这是女性永远无法完全理解或感激的。我并不反对婚姻本身。我反对的是那种缺乏了解、盲目乐观、本应预见、因单相思而加剧、羞愧驱使、注定破产、给孩子留下终身创伤的婚姻。</p>
<p>A woman loves you when she takes you for granted. That sounds odd I know, but it’s when she’s not fawning all over you and you’re in your 10th year of marriage and it’s just part of everyday conversation. “OK, love you, bye” is at the end of every phone call. You’re not thinking about it, because you don’t need to. If you’re asking the question “how do you know when she loves you?” You’re not in it. It’s only when that familiarity and regular comfort is removed that she can appreciate it. Once the commonness of love is established women will only rarely express it overtly – in fact the expression will be what’s expected of you – so you have to look for it covertly.
当一个女人对你习以为常时，她就是爱你的。我知道这听起来有些奇怪，但正是在她不再对你百般讨好，你们结婚十年，爱情已成为日常对话的一部分时。每次电话结束时，她都会说“好的，爱你，再见”。你不会去多想，因为你不需要。如果你还在问“如何知道她爱你？”那说明你还未真正感受到。只有当那份熟悉与日常的舒适感消失时，她才会意识到它的珍贵。一旦爱情的常态确立，女性很少会直接表达，实际上，表达爱意已成为对你的期待——所以你得从细微之处去寻找。</p>
<p>All the flowery crap you read in your Hallmark card on Valentines Day or your Anniversary was written by someone else. And while it’s nice to have these gestures of appreciation occasionally, it’s more important to see the forest for the trees. It’s not individual acts of affection or appreciation so much as it is the whole of what you both do on a regular day-to-day basis. It’s what you and she are all about after your three hundredth bowl of oatmeal together on a Saturday morning and your kids are fighting for control of the TV remote while you’re sitting across the breakfast table discussing which bills need to be paid first this month and how bad the lawn needs mowing that defines love and marriage. Yes, precisely the things you’ll never think about when you’re sarging her or considering moving her up in your plate spinning line up.
情人节或周年纪念日，你在贺卡上读到的那些花哨废话，都是别人写的。虽然偶尔收到这些表达感激之情的举动很美好，但更重要的是见树又见林。爱情和婚姻的真谛，并非单个的示爱或感激之举，而是你们日常每一天所做的一切。它体现在某个周六早晨，你们共进第三百碗燕麦粥时，孩子们争夺电视遥控器的吵闹声中；体现在早餐桌对面，你们讨论本月哪些账单需优先支付，以及草坪修剪得多么糟糕的时刻。没错，正是这些细节，当你在追求她，或考虑将她提升为你生活中众多事务的优先级时，你绝不会去思考的那些平凡瞬间，定义了爱情与婚姻的真谛。</p>
<p>This is what marriage is; not necessarily boring per se (although it certainly can be more often than not), but ordinary. It’s normal, common, or becomes so. Think about how many people who’ve lived, married and died on planet earth who did exactly the same things as you. That’s the real test of marriage that no one who hasn’t experienced it can really relate in any meaningful sense. The happy, Oprah-ized idea is that you have to “keep it fresh”, but even after a night of freshening it up and the Wal-Mart lingerie is in the clothes hamper, and you pick up the kids from spending the night at her sisters house the morning after, you go back to the day-to-day marriage you’ve always had. This is the shit no one tells you about when you’re being sold on the Marriage Goal – the “now what?” feeling that comes directly after you’ve found the ONE you’ve been looking for, or “did the right thing” with and married because she suddenly rediscovered religion AFTER you’d had marathon sex with her for 3 months straight and wouldn’t abort the pregnancy (and no, that didn’t happen to me).
这就是婚姻的本质；未必本身就无聊（尽管它确实常常如此），但平凡无奇。它普通、常见，或变得如此。想想地球上有多少人曾经生活、结婚并逝去，他们所做的与你如出一辙。这是婚姻真正的考验，未经此经历的人无法在任何有意义的层面上真正理解。那种快乐、被奥普拉化的观念认为，你必须“保持新鲜感”，但即便一夜激情过后，沃尔玛的性感内衣已躺在洗衣篮中，第二天早晨你从她姐姐家接回孩子，你又回到了一如既往的日常婚姻生活。这就是在你被推销婚姻目标时，无人告知你的那些事——在你找到一直在寻觅的那个人，或“做了正确的事”并与她结婚后，那种“现在怎么办？”的感觉随即而来，因为她在你与她连续三个月马拉松式性爱后突然重拾信仰，且不愿堕胎（不，那不是发生在我身上的事）。</p>
<h2 id="appreciation-赏识"><a class="header" href="#appreciation-赏识">Appreciation 赏识</a></h2>
<p>I think what most men uniquely deceive themselves of is that they will ultimately be appreciated by women for their sacrifices. Learn this now, you wont. You can’t be because women fundamentally lack the ability to fully realize, much less appreciate the sacrifices a man makes to facilitate her reality. Even the most enlightened, appreciative woman you know still operates in a feminne-centric reality. Men making the personal sacrifices necessary to honor, respect and love her are commonplace. You’re supposed to do those things. You sacrificed your ambitions and potential to provide her with a better life? You were supposed to. You resisted temptation and didn’t cheat on your wife with the hot secretary who was DTF and ready to go? You were supposed to. Your responsibilities to maintaining a marriage, a home, your family, etc. are common – they’re expected. They are only appreciated in their absence.</p>
<p>我认为大多数男性独特地欺骗自己的是，他们最终会因为自己的牺牲而受到女性的赞赏。现在就明白这一点，你不会。你无法做到，因为女性从根本上缺乏充分认识，更不用说欣赏一个男人为了她的现实所做出的牺牲。即使是你所知道的最开明、最感激的女性，仍然在一个以女性为中心的现实中运作。男性为了尊重、爱护她而做出必要的个人牺牲是司空见惯的。你应该做这些事。你牺牲了自己的抱负和潜力，为她提供更好的生活？那是你应该做的。你抵制诱惑，没有和那位愿意且准备好的火辣秘书出轨？那也是你应该做的。维护婚姻、家庭、家园等责任是常见的——它们是被期待的。只有在它们缺席时才会被感激。</p>
<p>This is the totality of the feminine-centric reality. Men only exist to facilitate the feminine reality, and any man who disputes this (or even analyzes its aspects) is therefore not a ‘man’. It just IS. Even the most self-serving, maverick among men is still beholden to the feminine imperative in that he’s only defined as a rebel because he doesn’t comply with the common practices of ‘men’ in a female defined reality. And ironically it’s just this maverick who is appreciated by the feminine above those men who would comply with it (or even promote it)  as a matter of course.</p>
<p>这就是女性中心现实的全部。男性仅作为促进女性现实的工具而存在，任何质疑这一点（甚至分析其方面）的男性因此便不再是“男人”。它就是这样。即便是最自私、最特立独行的男性，也仍受制于女性主导的规则，因为他之所以被定义为叛逆者，正是因为他不遵循女性定义现实中“男性”的常规做法。讽刺的是，正是这种特立独行者，在女性眼中超越了那些顺从（甚至推崇）这一现实的男性，从而得到她们的赞赏。</p>
<p>The concept of appreciation really dovetails into a lot of other aspects of intergender relations.</p>
<p>欣赏的概念确实与异性关系中的许多其他方面紧密契合。</p>
<p>For instance in The Mature Man thread; assume for a moment that a 40 y.o. Man with the options to pursue younger women “does the right thing” and seeks out a relationship with a woman his own age. Would he be appreciated for essentially giving an aged woman a new lease on life? Or would he be viewed as doing what is to be expected of him?</p>
<p>例如，在《成熟男人》主题帖中；假设一个 40 岁的男人在可以选择追求年轻女性时，“做了正确的事”，选择与同龄女性建立关系。他是否会因为实质上给予一位年长女性新的生活希望而受到赞赏？还是会被视为仅仅做了人们预期他会做的事情？</p>
<p>Would a man who marries a single mother and helps with the parental investment of another man’s child be appreciated more for having done so? Would it even factor into a woman’s estimation of his character, or would he simply doing what’s expected of a man?  The question of appreciation is a real quandary for the White Knight.</p>
<p>一个娶了单身母亲并协助抚养另一个男人孩子的男人，是否会因此受到更多赞赏？这会不会影响女性对他品性的评价，还是他只是在履行一个男人的期望？对于“白骑士”而言，这个问题确实令人困惑。</p>
<p><strong>Relationships aren’t work.</strong></p>
<p>关系并非工作。</p>
<p>Familiarity does in fact breed contempt,..and mediocrity, and routine, and banality, and commonness,.. which is why so many marriages end up in the shit can. Men and women give up on themselves.</p>
<p>熟悉确实会滋生轻蔑，以及平庸、例行公事、陈腐和普通，这就是为什么许多婚姻最终走向破裂。男男女女放弃了自己。</p>
<p>The “Relationships are work” meme is a Social Convention. How often do you hear men say these words? This has filtered into popular consciousness even with men now. For the LTR men who subscribe to this I’d also speculate that many of them are in relationships where THEY are “doing the work” for the women who are giving them the ‘grade’ so to speak. And of the single men who subscribe to this mythology, each had to be conditioned to believe this is the case in LTRs by women. This is rooted in the mistaken belief that men’s actions and sacrifices can ever be appreciated by women.</p>
<p>“关系即工作”的梗是一种社会规范。你有多常听到男性说这些话？即便在男性中，这一观念也已深入人心。对于那些认同这一点的长期关系（LTR）中的男性，我猜测其中许多人正处在为女性“付出努力”的关系中，而这些女性则在给予他们所谓的“评分”。至于那些单身的、信奉这一神话的男性，他们每个人都被女性所塑造，相信在长期关系中必须如此付出。这一切都基于一个错误的信念：男性所做的行动和牺牲终将得到女性的赏识。</p>
<p>What would the best method be to get a man to live up to the idealizations a woman has as her perfect mate (however twisted and convoluted this may have been defined for her)? Women love the ‘fixer upper’. “He’d be such a great guy if only he would, _____” or she’ll say “I’m working on him.” It’s when the conditioning goes from “I’m working on him” to “We’re working on our relationship” that he has now internalized her frame control. This is where the mythology of Relationships-as-Work is derived from. How often is it the woman who needs the ‘work’ in the relationship? And if it is her, the terminology of the relationship and the associations change. ‘Work’ implies a man better conforming his identity to her ideal relationship, to better fit the feminine-centric reality. And what better way to initiate this than to psychologically condition him to want to embody her ideal – even before he’s ever met a woman or been involved in a relationship?</p>
<p>要让一个男人达到女人心目中完美伴侣的理想形象（无论这个形象在她心中是如何扭曲和复杂地定义的），最佳方法是什么？女性喜欢“改造潜力股”。她会说：“如果他能做到_____，他就会是个很棒的人。”或者“我正在改造他。”当这种改造从“我正在改造他”转变为“我们在努力改善我们的关系”时，他就已经内化了她的框架控制。这就是“关系即工作”这一神话的起源。在关系中，有多少次是女性需要“工作”呢？如果是她，关系的术语和关联就会发生变化。“工作”意味着男性需要更好地将自己的身份调整为符合她理想中的关系，以更好地适应以女性为中心的现实。而要启动这一过程，最好的方法莫过于在心理上训练他，让他渴望成为她理想中的样子——甚至在遇见任何女性或涉入任何关系之前。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="kill-the-beta"><a class="header" href="#kill-the-beta">Kill the Beta</a></h1>
<p>Rational reader Paul recently sought out my guidance for probably the single most asked for advice I receive.
理性读者保罗最近寻求我的指导，这可能是我收到过的最常见的建议之一。</p>
<p><em>I’ve read through your blog entirely, and my biggest issue is, how do I kill the beta? Every girl I sleep with, or even fool around with, I end up developing feelings for. Even if it was a one night stand or the girl is cheating on a bf with me. It’s like I have no self control; like I’m a girl that agonizes over every guy she sleeps with.</em></p>
<p><em>我已经通读了你的博客，而我最大的困扰是，如何摆脱这种“备胎”身份？每次我和女孩发生关系，或是仅仅调情，最终都会对她们产生感情。即便只是一夜情，或是对方在与男友交往的同时与我出轨。我仿佛失去了自我控制力，就像一个为每个与她发生关系的男人而苦恼的女孩。</em></p>
<p>I wish I honestly had a definitive answer for Paul. If I could construct some step-by-step program, a universal template that men could all follow in order to kill their inner Beta, I’d be rich beyond my wildest dreams. Just as I said with about the Alpha Buddha, if I could find a way to bottle the essence of Alpha I’d be set for life. The real truth is that there is no simple answer to this, because each man’s conditions are unique to him. To be sure there are common roots to their problems, and common mindsets that form as results of attempting to formulate working sexual strategies (Beta Game) within the feminine Matrix, but undoing these mental schemas and reforming a better functional sexual strategy is unique to the individual.</p>
<p>我真心希望能给保罗一个明确的答案。如果我能构建一个步步为营的计划，一个通用模板，让所有男性都能遵循以消除内心的贝塔特质，我将富可敌国，梦想成真。正如我之前谈及阿尔法佛陀时所说，如果我能找到一种方法来提炼阿尔法本质，我将一生无忧。真正的真相是，对此没有简单的答案，因为每个人的情况都是独一无二的。诚然，他们的困境有共同的根源，尝试在女性矩阵中制定有效的性策略（贝塔游戏）时形成的共同心态，但解构这些心理模式并重塑更优的性策略则是个人化的过程。</p>
<p>I feel that this is the major reason Game is not taken as seriously as it should be – it’s a lot of work doing your own self-analysis and then creating a strategy to remake yourself. One of the reasons PUA gurus and the Game demigods of the last decade seem so cheap, like snake oil salesmen, is because they fail to take into account the degree of personalization necessary to truly kill the inner Beta that guys eventually have to confront. That’s an element of internalized Game that the guys doing seminars would rather not address because your degree of success, in truth how you even measure success, is entirely dependent upon you. Hooking up with girls you’d never had access to before may sell pick up DVDs; changing the inner workings of your personality is a much tougher order. If you ever look through the ‘self-help’ psychology section of a book store and wonder why there are so many books published in the topic, it’s exactly due to this dynamic – effecting a fundamental change in one’s life requires an effort that few people have the patience and perseverance for.</p>
<p>我认为这是游戏未被足够重视的主要原因——进行自我分析并制定重塑自我的策略是一项艰巨的工作。过去十年中，PUA 大师和游戏半神们显得廉价，如同卖蛇油的小贩，原因之一是他们未能考虑到个性化程度，这是真正消灭男性最终必须面对的内在贝塔所必需的。这是那些举办研讨会的家伙宁愿避而不谈的内在游戏元素，因为你的成功程度，甚至你如何衡量成功，完全取决于你自己。与以往无法接触的女孩搭讪或许能卖出搭讪 DVD；改变个性的内在机制则是一个更为艰巨的任务。如果你曾浏览书店的“自助”心理学区，并好奇为何该主题有如此多的书籍出版，这正是由于这一动态——实现生活中的根本改变需要大多数人缺乏的耐心和毅力。</p>
<p>So with all of this in mind, let me say right now, I don’t have a map for you – anyone telling you they do is selling you something – however, I will attempt to point you in the right direction. I can’t say what will work, only you can find that out on your own, but try to bear in mind that changing yourself is a process that takes time. Even for the guy’s who have an easier go of transitioning to an internal Game-state personality, it’s still an ongoing process. I’d like to think of myself as at least a lesser Alpha (by Roissy’s measure), but that doesn’t mean I don’t trip up at times. This is what I mean by the process; you’re not going to be bulletproof and pass every shit test ever thrown at you, but be encouraged in knowing you learn from what you do wrong and adjust for the next time. There is no grand arrival moment when you know you’re an Alpha, or if you don’t like that term, there is no definitive point at which you’ve internalized Game. You don’t get some certificate of Game completion. You can, however, definitively change your thinking, it’s always on-going.</p>
<p>因此，考虑到所有这些，我在此明确表示，我没有地图供你参考——任何声称拥有地图的人都是在向你兜售东西——然而，我会尽力为你指明正确的方向。我无法断言什么方法会奏效，只有你自己才能亲自发现，但请记住，改变自己是一个需要时间的过程。即便对于那些在转变为内在游戏状态人格时较为顺利的人来说，这仍然是一个持续进行的过程。我愿意认为自己至少算是一个较小的阿尔法（按照 Roissy 的标准），但这并不意味着我不会有失误的时候。这就是我所说的过程；你不会变得无懈可击，也不会通过每一次被抛出的考验，但要知道，你可以从错误中学习并调整以应对下一次。没有那种你确信自己成为阿尔法的辉煌时刻，或者如果你不喜欢这个术语，也没有一个明确的点标志着你已经内化了游戏。你不会获得某种游戏完成的证书。然而，你可以明确地改变你的思维方式，这是一个持续不断的过程。</p>
<p><strong>Knowing is half the battle</strong>
<strong>了解是成功的一半</strong></p>
<p>If there truly is a first step in internalization then it has to come from educating yourself. This is actually one of the most difficult tasks. If you’re a reader of my blog, or are at least peripherally aware of Game as a concept, this is going to seem pretty obvious, but remember that there’s an entire world of men who are still plugged in. Only a fraction of them will even be amenable to considering Game and positive masculinity, and fewer still will see its value. From our perspective it seems like a matter of course; we read the books/blogs, familiarize ourselves with the concepts, we pick what might work, experiment with ideas, evaluate the validity of them and adopt them or toss them. However what’s apparent to the unplugged seems like blaspheme to the plugged in.</p>
<p>如果内化的确存在第一步，那么它必然始于自我教育。这实际上是最艰巨的任务之一。如果你是我的博客读者，或至少对“游戏”概念有所耳闻，这听起来可能相当明显，但请记住，世界上仍有许多男性深陷其中。他们中只有少数人会愿意考虑“游戏”和积极男性气质，更少的人会认识到其价值。从我们的角度看，这似乎是理所当然的；我们阅读书籍/博客，熟悉相关概念，挑选可能有效的方法，尝试各种想法，评估其合理性，并采纳或摒弃。然而，对于未接触过的人来说显而易见的事物，在那些深陷其中的人看来却如同亵渎。</p>
<p>Your “education” doesn’t stop once you’ve unplugged. In fact I’d argue that it’s even more vital in internalizing a new mindset since you’re now putting things into practice. One thing I remind guys who spit the red pill back up is that there is no going back. A lot of frustrated guys who discover Game and fail to apply it because they lack the social skills or they convinced themselves that PUArtistry was their easy magic formula to fuck the girl of their dreams, they tend to want to regress back into the comfortable shell of their former ignorance of intergender social dynamics. Only they find that there is no return. They see the truth in the what they’d been blind to no matter where they turn. The social interactions, the feminization, the raw deal they’ve been conditioned to accept as normal – all of that subtly reminds them of the truth they’re avoiding and they hate it. They become hostile to it.</p>
<p>你的“教育”并不会在你断开连接后停止。事实上，我认为在实践中内化一种新思维方式时，它甚至更为关键。我经常提醒那些吐出红药丸的人，没有回头路。许多感到沮丧的男性发现了游戏规则却未能应用，因为他们缺乏社交技能，或者他们自欺欺人地认为 PUArtistry 是他们轻松搞定梦中女孩的魔法公式，这些人往往想要退回到他们以前对两性社交动态无知的舒适壳中。然而，他们发现无法回头。无论转向何方，他们都能看到曾经视而不见的真相。社交互动、女性化、他们被教导接受为正常的苛刻待遇——这一切都在微妙地提醒他们逃避的真相，这让他们感到厌恶。他们对这一切产生了敌意。</p>
<p>I add this because it’s a very real danger for guys transitioning into internalizing positive masculinity. In the same respect you now have become (or should become) more sensitive to Game truths and the unplugged reality you now find yourself in. There’s a point of departure from what you thought was normal to seeing the signs around you. An easy illustration is really contemplating any gender related issue in popular media. You’ll hear a song, watch a sit-com, overhear a conversation in the lunch room, and begin to realize how surrounded you are by basic presumptions of a culture remade by feminine primacy. Understanding what your position in all of this is is crucial to internalizing a new mindset or backsliding into your old frame of thinking.</p>
<p>我之所以添加这一点，是因为对于那些正在内化积极男性气质的过渡期男性来说，这是一个非常真实的危险。同样地，你现在变得更加（或应该变得更加）敏感，能够洞察游戏中的真相以及你所处的未加修饰的现实。从你认为的正常状态到开始察觉周围的迹象，这是一个转折点。一个简单的例子是深入思考流行媒体中的任何性别相关问题。你会听到一首歌、观看一部情景喜剧、在午餐室无意中听到一段对话，并开始意识到自己被女性主导文化重塑的基本假设所包围。理解你在这一切中的位置对于内化新思维模式或倒退回旧的思维框架至关重要。</p>
<h3 id="practicing-the-change-实践变革"><a class="header" href="#practicing-the-change-实践变革">Practicing the change 实践变革</a></h3>
<p>It should be self-evident that applying what you’ve come to see as a new truth for yourself is vital. You need to get off the internet and field test the theories you learn here and elsewhere. Whether that means going to sarge at the clubs, or adopting a new attitude with your wife, or even the women you deal with at work, it’s really up to you. The hardest part of practicing change is the initial shock of having the people who know you question the validity of the new you. If you were to move to a new city, completely change your social circle and play the role of an asshole Alpha, no one is the wiser. However, make a radical shift in your personality with those who’ve known you for years and you’ll be a poser who’s “trying to be something he’s not”.</p>
<p>不言而喻，将你视为新真理的理念付诸实践至关重要。你需要离开网络，在现实中检验你在这里或其他地方学到的理论。无论是去夜店搭讪，还是以新态度对待你的妻子，或是与你工作中的女性打交道，这都取决于你。实践改变最难的部分是，那些了解你的人质疑新你的真实性所带来的初始冲击。如果你搬到一个新城市，彻底改变社交圈并扮演一个混蛋阿尔法角色，无人会察觉。然而，在那些认识你多年的人面前做出性格上的激进转变，你会被视为“试图成为不是自己的人”的装腔作势者。</p>
<p>Human beings need predictability – it gives them a sense of control over others. When you alter yourself, or have your personality altered by an outside force, this is a threat to that predictability, so the logical counter is for others to attempt to put us back into our places. Shaming comes as a natural tactic for women, but the push is always to get you back into their frame. And that’s essentially the threat others interpret, the new you is a frame grab. Do it all at once and people will accuse your personality of being a disingenuous reaction to having been burned. Do it subtly and persistently over a time and people will be more willing to accept the change as genuine. Always insist on change, but never too quickly.</p>
<p>人类需要可预测性——它赋予他们对他人掌控感。当你改变自己，或被外界力量改变性格时，这便对这种可预测性构成威胁，因此，他人逻辑上的应对便是试图让我们回归原位。羞辱成为女性自然的手段，但推动总是让你回到她们的框架内。这本质上就是他人所解读的威胁，新的你是一个框架捕捉。若一次性全部改变，人们会指责你的性格是对曾经受伤的虚伪反应。若微妙而持续地随时间改变，人们则更愿意接受这种变化的真实性。始终坚持改变，但切勿过快。</p>
<p>This is important to remember because your friends will be your biggest source of doubt in your transformation. They might mean well, but understand, that intent comes from a desire to see normalcy, not your best interest. The first time an old girl-friend you had a thing for calls the new you an “asshole”, it’s kind of a shock to the system. There’s always this stab at the old you who wants to set things rights, but you have to resist this impulse to take offense. It’s really hard to say “yeah, I am an asshole” as a point of pride when your whole prior life’s learning taught you not to offend others and particularly not girls you ever wanted to fuck. It’s counterintuitive to the beta in you. As sadistic as it sounds, you’ll be more consistently rewarded for your capacity to indirectly offend the women you want to get with, and the internal conflict this creates between the beta you and the burgeoning alpha you is the hardest part to reconcile. This is where most guys fail in transitioning, and this is primarily due to an unpracticed ability to keep their emotions in check.</p>
<p>这一点至关重要，因为你的朋友将成为你转变过程中最大的疑虑来源。他们或许出于好意，但请明白，这种意图源于对常态的渴望，而非对你的最佳利益。当你曾心仪的前女友首次称新生的你为“混蛋”时，这无疑是对心灵的冲击。总有一股力量试图唤醒旧日的你，希望你纠正这一切，但你须抵制这种冲动，不为此动怒。承认“没错，我是个混蛋”并以之为荣，对你而言极为艰难，因为你过往的人生教导你不要冒犯他人，尤其是那些你曾渴望亲近的女孩。这与你的内在顺从者（beta）本能相悖。尽管听起来有些残忍，但你会发现，通过间接冒犯那些你渴望接近的女性，你将获得更持续的回报，而这种行为在你内心顺从者与初露锋芒的领导者（alpha）之间引发的冲突，是最难以调和的部分。这正是大多数人在转变过程中失败的关键所在，主要原因在于他们缺乏控制情绪的实践能力。</p>
<h3 id="aesthetics-vs-social-robots"><a class="header" href="#aesthetics-vs-social-robots">Aesthetics vs. Social Robots</a></h3>
<p>美学与社交机器人</p>
<p>As I’ve stated before, men are the True Romantics, women are simply the vehicles for that rarely appreciated romanticism. One of the biggest gripes the post-sexual revolution feminization had with men was some prepackaged notion that men weren’t in touch with their feminine sides. We were “out of touch with our feelings”. God curse Carl Jung’s rotten corpse to hell for ever convincing popular culture that each sex had equal, but unexpressed, measures of feminine and masculine energies. Western culture has been so saturated with Jungian theory that we don’t recognize it as such. It’s become normalized to believe an idealized goal-state is a genderless, androgynous society.</p>
<p>如我先前所述，男性才是真正的浪漫主义者，女性不过是承载这种鲜为人知的浪漫主义的载体。后性解放时代女性化思潮对男性的一大不满，在于某些预设观念认为男性未能触及自身的女性特质。我们被视为“情感脱节”。愿卡尔·荣格的腐朽遗骸在地狱中受诅咒，因为他竟说服大众文化相信，两性各自拥有相等但未表达的女性与男性能量。西方文化深受荣格理论浸染，以至于我们对此习以为常，不以为异。一个理想化的目标状态——无性别、雌雄同体的社会——已被视为常态。</p>
<p>Rants aside, up until the last 50 years, it has in fact been men who’ve been the sex with the most self-control regarding emotion. It’s been just this reservation that’s made Men more endearing to women. Either as enigmatic poets and artists to figure out, or as natural stoics who’s every measured expression of emotion is an event unto it’s self,  it’s been Men’s classic reservation of emotional inaccessiblity  that’s made women more interested in Men. In contemporary society, men are encouraged to express themselves as a primary way to accessing a woman’s intimacy – essentially killing any sense of mystery to unravel with full disclosure. Brain function gender differences aside, It would be my guess that men socially evolved a more reserved expression of emotion, not due to some juvenile insecurity, but rather because it so consistently worked in generating interest in women.</p>
<p>撇开抱怨不谈，直到最近 50 年，实际上一直是男性在情感控制方面表现出更多的自制力。正是这种克制，使得男性对女性更具吸引力。无论是作为神秘的诗人或艺术家，让人探究其内心，还是作为天生的坚忍者，他们每一次深思熟虑的情感表达都显得格外重要，男性对情感的典型保留态度，正是激发女性对男性兴趣的关键。在当代社会，男性被鼓励以表达自我为主要方式来接近女性的亲密感——这实质上消除了任何需要解开的神秘感，因为一切都已完全公开。抛开大脑功能性别差异不谈，我猜测男性在社交中演化出更内敛的情感表达，并非出于某种幼稚的不安全感，而是因为这种做法在激发女性兴趣方面一直颇为有效。</p>
<p>Not so in this age. At every instance boys and men are conditioned to think that emotional expression is a means to solving problems. Boys don’t cry, was instituted with a purpose. Unguarded easily expressed emotion is a feminine trait. It’s not that men should become social robots, deadened to all but the most intense emotion; it’s just become normalized to cheapen that expression by overuse. Displays of a Man’s emotions should be rarely given devine gifts  for women who are generally lacking in true appreciation as it is.
在这个时代并非如此。男孩和男性在每个时刻都被引导去认为，情感表达是解决问题的一种手段。"男孩不哭"这一观念的形成有其目的。未经克制、轻易流露的情感被视为女性特质。这并不是说男性应该变成社交机器人，对除了最强烈情感之外的一切都麻木不仁；只是通过过度使用来贬低情感表达已成为常态。男性情感的展现，本应是难得的、赋予女性的神圣礼物，因为女性通常本身就缺乏真正的欣赏能力。</p>
<p>Unlearn what you have learned
忘却你所学的一切</p>
<p>It’s very difficult for a beta man, conditioned for so long to be emotionally available, to turn these emotions off. The good news is I’m not suggesting you do, I am suggesting you unlearn your reasons for developing emotional sentiments so easily. It’s easy to go emotionally cold as a result of being burned, it’s a much taller order to tamp that emotionality back into check when you’re really feeling good about it. Our emotions make us human and humane. It’s important to embrace that, but equally important to see how easily it’s used against you. You need to unlearn the reasons why you’re so easily emotional. Maybe it’s abandonment issues, maybe it’s a more deliberate conditioning in your upbringing.</p>
<p>对于一个长期被训练得情感丰富、易于表达的贝塔男来说，要关闭这些情感非常困难。好消息是，我并非建议你这么做，而是建议你摒弃那些轻易产生情感倾向的原因。因受伤而变得情感冷漠很容易，但当你真正感觉良好时，要重新控制住这种情感则更为艰难。我们的情感使我们成为有血有肉的人，珍视这一点至关重要，但同样重要的是认识到情感如何轻易被他人利用。你需要摒弃那些让你轻易动情的原因。或许是遗弃问题，或许是你成长过程中更为刻意的情感训练。</p>
<p>Remember in high school, in drivers ed class, when you were taught to turn into a skid rather than turn with the skid? When we’re driving and we find ourselves in a skid our natural impulse is to slam on the the breaks and/or, worse still, to turn with the skid. Everything in our self-preservation instincts tells us to do this, but all it does is aggravate an already precarious situation. However, when we’re taught, and we practice, not hitting the brakes and not turning into the skid, often enough we make this our default reaction and we find that the car rights itself, we avoid disaster and continue safely on down the road.</p>
<p>记得在高中时，在驾驶课上，老师教我们遇到侧滑时要顺着侧滑方向转弯，而不是逆着侧滑方向转弯吗？当我们开车时发现自己处于侧滑状态，本能反应往往是猛踩刹车，甚至更糟糕的是，顺着侧滑方向转弯。我们的自我保护本能告诉我们这样做，但实际上这只会加剧原本已经危险的局面。然而，当我们被教导并练习不踩刹车、不顺着侧滑方向转弯时，久而久之，这种做法会成为我们的默认反应，我们会发现车子会自行纠正，我们避免了灾难，并能安全地继续前行。</p>
<p>You have to unlearn the old behaviors and condition new ones in order to right your course. This takes practice and repetition – even in the face of conditions that you would impulsively think would need to be reacted to otherwise.There is no substitute for perseverance.</p>
<p>你必须摒弃旧有的行为模式，并培养新的习惯，以纠正你的方向。这需要练习和重复——即使在面对那些你本能认为需要立即反应的情况时也是如此。坚持不懈是无可替代的。</p>
<p>Changing your mind about yourself is the first step. This is actually the most difficult step for guys because most don’t want to believe they need to internalize a new way of thinking about themselves. Lethargy, for the most part, can be the primary reason most guys don’t want to change. It’s far easier to create rationales for oneself as to why they are happy in their present condition than it is to critically confront and initiate real change.</p>
<p>改变自我认知是第一步，对男性而言，这实际上是最具挑战的一步，因为大多数人不愿相信自己需要内化一种新的自我思考方式。大部分情况下，惰性可能是大多数男性不愿改变的主要原因。为自己创造理由，解释为何满足于现状，远比批判性地直面问题并启动真正的改变要容易得多。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t give you some standardized program to help you magically turn into the Man you hope to be. Only you can determine that course, but I will say this, the Man you wish to become requires you to take action. The goal posts for your own satisfaction will always keep moving away from you, and that’s a good thing. This is what inspires us to grow and mature and develop a capacity to overcome challenges. However, all this requires action on your part.</p>
<p>遗憾的是，我无法提供一个标准化的程序，助你神奇地蜕变成你所期望的模样。唯有你自己能决定这条道路，但我要说，你渴望成为的那个人需要你采取行动。你自我满足的目标标杆总会不断远离你，而这实为好事。正是这激励我们成长、成熟，并培养出克服挑战的能力。然而，这一切都需要你付诸行动。</p>
<p>You can pore through all of the advice and sift out the wisdom from this blog and the community at large, but none of it will amount to anything for you if you wont act. I can’t begin to recall all of the times I’ve counseled young guys, giving them all manner of advice and encouraging them to put it into practice, only to have them constantly bemoan that they can’t find the motivation. More often than not it takes some traumatic experience or they have to be reduced to having nothing left to lose before they’ll really have the fire lit under their asses to become more than they are.</p>
<p>你可以仔细研读这篇博客及整个社区的所有建议，从中提炼出智慧，但如果你不付诸行动，这一切对你都毫无意义。我无法一一回忆起曾多少次给年轻小伙子们提供各种建议，鼓励他们付诸实践，结果他们却总是哀叹找不到动力。通常情况下，只有经历了某种创伤性事件，或是到了一无所有、无路可退的境地，他们才会真正被激发出内在的火焰，从而超越现状。</p>
<p>I don’t consider myself a motivational speaker, but at some point you have to cross the abyss and change your mind about yourself.</p>
<p>我不自视为激励演讲者，但总有一天，你必须跨越深渊，改变对自己的看法。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="truth-to-power"><a class="header" href="#truth-to-power">Truth to Power</a></h1>
<p><em>Denying the utility of Power, vilifying it’s usages, is in itself a a means of using Power.</em>
<em>否认权力的效用，诋毁其使用，本身就是一种运用权力的手段。</em></p>
<p>Real change works from the inside out. If you don’t change your mind about yourself you wont change anything else. Women can change their hair color, their makeup, clothes, breast size, and any number of cosmetic alteration on a whim or as they can afford them, but the constant discontent, the constant inadequecies they complain of are rooted in their self-perceptions, not how others perceive them.</p>
<p>真正的改变是由内而外发生的。如果你不改变对自己的看法，你就不会改变其他任何事情。女性可以随心所欲或根据经济能力改变发色、妆容、衣着、胸部大小以及进行各种整容手术，但她们不断抱怨的不满和不足，根源在于自我认知，而非他人对她们的看法。</p>
<p>This is an outside-in mentality; hoping the external will change the internal, and it’s just this mentality that lesser men apply to themselves – the only difference being the application. The AFC (for lack of a better term) has the same problem as the vain woman (OK, really any woman) – a lack of true self-understanding of their own problem. It’s very difficult to do self-analysis and self-criticism, particularly when it comes to questioning our own beliefs and the reasons our personalities are what they are. It’s akin to telling someone they’re not living their lives ‘correctly’ or that they’re raising their children ‘wrong’; only it’s more difficult because we’re doing the telling about ourselves to ourselves. Self-estimation (not self-esteem) NEVER happens spontaneously, there always has to be some crisis to prompt it. Anxiety, trauma and crisis are necessary catalysts to stimulate self-consciousness. A breakup, a death, a betrayal; tragically, it’s at these points in our lives that we do our best introspection, we have our ‘moments of clarity’ and yes, discover what abysmal, simpering chumps we’ve allowed ourselves to be molded into.</p>
<p>这是一种由外而内的思维方式；希望外部因素能改变内在，而正是这种思维方式，被那些不如我们的人应用于自身——唯一的区别在于应用的方式。AFC（暂且如此称呼）与虚荣的女性（好吧，实际上任何女性）面临着同样的问题——缺乏对自己问题的真正自我理解。进行自我分析和自我批评非常困难，尤其是在质疑我们自己的信念以及我们的性格为何如此时。这类似于告诉某人他们没有“正确”地生活，或者他们“错误”地抚养孩子；只是这更困难，因为我们是在对自己进行自我告诫。自我评估（非自尊）永远不会自发发生，总是需要某种危机来触发。焦虑、创伤和危机是激发自我意识的必要催化剂。分手、死亡、背叛；可悲的是，正是在这些人生节点上，我们进行了最深刻的内省，拥有了“清晰的时刻”，并发现我们竟允许自己被塑造成如此可悲、谄媚的懦夫。</p>
<h2 id="denial-否认"><a class="header" href="#denial-否认">Denial 否认</a></h2>
<p>The first step to really unplugging from our preconditioning (i.e the feminine Matrix) is recognizing that this conditioning has led to the beliefs we think are integral to our personalities. The psychological term for this is called ‘ego-investment’. When a person internalizes a mental schema so thoroughly, and has become conditioned to it for so long, it becomes an integral part of their personality. So to attack the belief is to, literally, attack the person. This is why we see such a violent reaction to people’s political, religious, inter-social/inter-sexual, inter-gender, etc. expressions of belief – they perceive it as a personal attack, even when presented with irrefutable, empirical evidence that challenges the veracity of those beliefs.</p>
<p>真正摆脱我们预先设定的束缚（即女性矩阵）的第一步，是认识到这种设定导致了我们认为与个性密不可分的信念。心理学上称之为“自我投入”。当一个人如此彻底地内化了一种心理模式，并长期受其条件制约，它便成为其人格不可或缺的一部分。因此，攻击这种信念，实际上就是在攻击这个人。这就是为什么我们在面对人们关于政治、宗教、社会内部/性别间、性别间等的信念表达时，会看到如此激烈的反应——他们将其视为个人攻击，即便面对无可辩驳的实证证据，这些证据挑战了那些信念的真实性。</p>
<p>One common frustration that Game-aware Men express is how dificult it is to open an AFCs eyes as to why he’s not hooking up, why he’s not getting dates (or 2nd dates if he is), why he’s constantly getting LJBF rejections, etc., and all the flaws in what is really ego-investment internalizations. As I’m fond of saying, it’s dirty work unplugging chumps from the Matrix, and this is made all the more difficult when a person is in a catagorical state of denial.</p>
<p>游戏意识男人们常表达的一个挫败感是，如何让一个 AFC（平均挫败男）明白他为何无法成功搭讪、为何总是约不到会（或即使有初次约会也难有第二次）、为何屡遭 LJBF（仅限友谊）拒绝等等，以及他内心深处那些自我投资内化的种种缺陷。正如我常说的，将傻瓜从矩阵中解脱出来是件脏活，而当一个人处于绝对否认的状态时，这项任务就变得更加困难了。</p>
<p>People resort to denial when recognizing that the truth would destroy something they hold dear. In the case of a cheating partner, denial lets you avoid acknowledging evidence of your own humiliation. Short of catching a spouse in bed with your best friend, evidence of infidelity is usually ambiguous. It’s motivated skepticism. You’re more skeptical of things you don’t want to believe and demand a higher level of proof. Denial is unconscious, or it wouldn’t work: if you know you’re closing your eyes to the truth, some part of you knows what the truth is and denial can’t perform its protective function.</p>
<p>当人们意识到真相会摧毁他们珍视的事物时，往往会采取否认的态度。以伴侣出轨为例，否认使你得以回避承认自己遭受羞辱的证据。除非当场捉奸在床，否则出轨的证据通常是模糊不清的。这是一种有动机的怀疑，你对于不愿相信的事情更加怀疑，并要求更高标准的证明。否认是无意识的，否则它就无法发挥作用：如果你知道自己正对真相视而不见，那么你内心某处其实知晓真相，否认也就无法执行其保护功能了。</p>
<p>One thing we all struggle to protect is a positive self-image. The more important the aspect of your self-image that’s challenged by the truth, the more likely you are to go into denial. If you have a strong sense of self-worth and competence, your self-image can take hits but remain largely intact; if you’re beset by self-doubt (a hallmark of self-righteous AFC thinking), however, any acknowledgment of failure can be devastating and any admission of error painful to the point of being unthinkable. Self-justification and denial arise from the dissonance between believing you’re competent, and making a mistake, which clashes with that image. Solution: deny the mistake. Attribute it to an outside element (women won’t play by “the rules”) rather than resort to introspection (maybe I’m wrong about “the rules”?).</p>
<p>我们共同竭力维护的是积极自我形象。当真相挑战到你自我形象中越重要的方面，你就越可能陷入否认。若你拥有强烈的自我价值感和能力感，你的自我形象虽会受到打击但大体保持完好；然而，若你深受自我怀疑困扰（这是自以为是 AFC 思维的标志），任何对失败的承认都可能是毁灭性的，任何错误的坦白都痛苦到难以想象。自我辩护与否认源自于你认为自己有能力与犯错之间的不协调，这种冲突与你的形象相悖。解决办法：否认错误，将其归咎于外部因素（女性不遵守“规则”）而非内省（或许我对“规则”的理解有误？）。</p>
<p>Therefore we see AFCs tenaciously cling to a moralistic sense of purpose in their methods which is only reinforced by popular culture in our media, our music, eHarmony, our religion, etc.</p>
<p>因此，我们看到 AFC 们（平均水平的男性）在追求目标时，执着地坚守着一种道德主义的方法，这种执着在流行文化中得到了进一步强化，无论是在我们的媒体、音乐、eHarmony 交友平台，还是我们的宗教等领域。</p>
<h2 id="articles-of-power-权力条款"><a class="header" href="#articles-of-power-权力条款">Articles of Power 权力条款</a></h2>
<p>The term Power has a lot of  misapplied connotations to it. When we think of Powerful people, we think of influence, wealth, prestige, status and the ability to have others do our bidding – all of these are not Power. And as much as we’d like to convince ourselves that women are attracted to this Power, this is false. Because what I’ve described as aspects of Power here are really manifestations of Power. Here’s a cosmic secret revealed for you:
"权力"一词承载着许多被误用的内涵。当我们想到有权势的人时，我们联想到的是影响力、财富、声望、地位以及驱使他人服从的能力——这些其实都不是真正的权力。尽管我们可能倾向于说服自己，女性会被这种权力所吸引，但这是错误的。因为我所描述的这些权力表象，实际上只是权力的体现。现在，让我为你揭示一个宇宙的秘密：</p>
<p>Real Power is the degree to which a person has control over their own circumstances. Real Power is the degree to which we control the directions of our lives.
真正的力量体现在一个人对其自身境遇的掌控程度。真正的力量是我们对人生方向的控制程度。</p>
<p>When we allow our thinking, our personality disorders and our mental schemas, combined with their accompanying behaviors, to determine the course of our decisions, we relenquish real Power. The man who succumbs, by force or by will, to the responsibilities, liabilities and accountabilities that are required of him by society, marriage, committment, family, fatherhood, career choice, etc. leaves him very little influence over the course of his own life.
当我们允许自己的思维、人格障碍和心理模式，以及伴随的行为，决定我们的决策方向时，我们便放弃了真正的力量。那个屈服于社会、婚姻、承诺、家庭、父亲身份、职业选择等所要求的责任、义务和问责的人，几乎无法掌控自己的人生轨迹。</p>
<p>The painter Paul Gaugin is one of history’s most powerful men. At middle age Paul was a “successful” banker, with a wife and children and by all appearances, a man of great merit and considerable wealth. Then one day Paul decided he’d had enough and wanted to paint. He left his wife, children and his money, and decided he would become a painter. He cast off his former life to live the life he chose, he had the power to assume control of it. Eventually he died in Tahiti, but not after having one of the most interesting of lives and becoming a world renowned painter. You may think, what a horrible man he was to abandon his responsibilities to selfishly pursue his own desires, but the fact remains that he had the Power within himself to do so that most men would shudder to even consider. So entrapped are we in our self-expectation and self-imposed limitations that we fail to see that we have always had the keys to our own prisons – we’re just scared shitless to use them.</p>
<p>画家保罗·高更，是历史上极具影响力的人物之一。中年时期的保罗，是一位“成功”的银行家，拥有妻儿，从各方面看，都是一位德高望重且相当富有的人。然而，某天保罗决定他受够了，渴望投身绘画。他抛下了妻子、孩子和财富，决心成为一名画家。他摒弃了过往的生活，选择了自己想要的人生，并拥有掌控这一切的力量。最终，他在塔希提岛离世，但在那之前，他度过了一段极为精彩的人生，并成为享誉世界的画家。你或许会认为，他是个多么可恶的人，为了自私地追求个人欲望而抛弃责任，但事实是，他拥有大多数男人连想都不敢想的力量去这么做。我们深陷于自我期待和自我设定的限制中，以至于未能意识到，我们一直握有打开自身牢笼的钥匙——只是我们害怕得要命，不敢使用它们。</p>
<p>This Power is the root of that all important ‘confidence’ we toss out every time we tell a 19 y.o. chump what women really want so he can get laid. It’s this ability to make our own decisions, right or wrong, and to confidently own them that separate us from “other guys.” It’s this self-guided Power that evokes a seemingly irrational confidence to Spin Plates, to assert ourselves and to be unafraid to make ourselves the PRIZE, and it’s just this Power that women want to be associated with.</p>
<p>这种力量是我们每次告诉一个 19 岁小伙子女性真正想要什么以便他能得手时所抛出的“自信”的根源。正是这种做出自己决定的能力，无论对错，并自信地拥有它们，将我们与“其他男人”区分开来。正是这种自我引导的力量激发了一种看似不合理的自信，去旋转盘子，去自我主张，去无所畏惧地将自己塑造成奖赏，而这正是女性想要与之关联的力量。</p>
<p>Lack of this Power is exactly what makes master PUAs revert to some of the most pathetic AFCs once they become involved in an LTR. They sell women on this idealization and the perception that they possess this Power only to discover the AFC insecurities these behaviors were meant to cover up once they’ve bought the act. This isn’t to devalue PUA skills as effective behavior sets, rather it’s meant to illustrate the behaviors that should be manifest as a result of effecting a real personal change. It should be that adopting a positive-masculine mental schema prompts these PUA skills as a result. Instead we have the cart before the horse in a mad rush to get that all important pussy we’ve been deprived of for so long, by masking our deficit in real Power and understanding with rote memorized PUA techniques hoping that by practicing them they’ll turn into “natural game” and we’ll mature enough to initiate a lasting personal change.</p>
<p>缺乏这种力量正是导致大师级 PUA 在进入长期关系（LTR）后退化为最可悲的 AFC（平均挫男）的原因。他们向女性兜售这种理想化形象，以及他们拥有这种力量的错觉，一旦女性相信了这套表演，就会发现这些行为原本是为了掩盖 AFC 的不安全感。这并不是要贬低 PUA 技巧作为有效行为集合的价值，而是旨在阐明应因真正个人变革而显现的行为。本应是采纳积极阳刚的思维模式自然而然地引发这些 PUA 技能。然而，我们却本末倒置，急切地用死记硬背的 PUA 技巧来掩饰我们在真正力量和理解上的不足，寄希望于通过练习这些技巧能转化为“自然游戏”，并促使我们成熟到足以启动持久个人变革的地步。</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="have-a-look"><a class="header" href="#have-a-look">Have A Look</a></h1>
<p>One of the hardest things to drive home for a freshly unplugged guy is their tendency towards absolutism. You can’t really blame a guy who’s been desperate for intimacy for so long to want to follow some prescribed program that will only solve his most immediate problem. “OK, what do I haffta do to get girls? Wear this? Say this? Act like so?,..” It’s exactly this type of literalistic, binary bent that makes most Plugins skeptical of the proponents of Game, and thus the veracity of Game itself.</p>
<p>对于一个刚脱离束缚的人来说，最难灌输的一点就是他们倾向于绝对主义。你不能真的责怪一个长期渴望亲密关系的人，希望遵循某个规定程序来解决他最迫切的问题。“好吧，我该怎么做才能吸引女孩？穿这个？说这个？表现得这样？……”正是这种字面化、二元化的倾向，使得大多数插件用户对游戏倡导者持怀疑态度，进而对游戏本身的可信度产生质疑。</p>
<p>Understanding the difference between Peacocking and having a style is one of these major entanglements. “Wear a funny top hat? Black nail polish? Get the fuck outta here!,..” Most guys new to Game tend to conflate the more extreme aspects of Peacocking with having a style or as Adam Carolla puts it here, having A look. This is a very awkward progression for ‘regular’ guys to make because for so long they’ve been told to Just Be Themselves. They find comfort in saying things like “I don’t want to be with a girl who doesn’t like me for who I am” yet wonder why they’re dateless virgins who’ve never kissed a girl at 29.</p>
<p>理解孔雀开屏与拥有个人风格之间的区别，是这些主要困惑之一。“戴一顶滑稽的高顶帽？涂黑色指甲油？滚开吧！...”大多数刚接触游戏的新手倾向于将孔雀开屏的更极端方面与拥有风格或如亚当·卡罗拉在此所说的“一种形象”混为一谈。对于“普通”男性来说，这是一个非常尴尬的转变过程，因为他们长期以来一直被教导要“做自己”。他们在说出“我不想和一个不喜欢真正的我的女孩在一起”这样的话时感到安慰，却又纳闷为何自己 29 岁了还是个没有约会经历、从未亲吻过女孩的处男。</p>
<p>A Look 一瞥</p>
<p>It’s important to have A Look. The basis of physical attraction is going to be conditional for any individual girl, but always bear in mind that A look is contextual. The archetypal “douchebag” with tats and an MMA appeal is a Look. Guyliner, black nail polish and Emo skinny jeans is a Look. The guy in a 3 piece Armani has a Look, and there are dozens more, but the point is that women are in fact like casting agents looking for the right character to fill a role.</p>
<p>拥有一种“形象”至关重要。对任何女孩而言，身体吸引的基础都是条件性的，但始终要记住，“形象”是具有情境性的。那种带有纹身和综合格斗魅力的典型“混蛋”形象是一种“形象”。涂着眼线、黑色指甲油以及穿着紧身牛仔裤的“情绪化”风格也是一种“形象”。身着三件套阿玛尼西装的男士同样拥有一种“形象”，这样的例子不胜枚举，但关键在于，女性实际上就像选角导演，在寻找适合角色的合适人选。</p>
<p>But, does “A” look really imply “any” look? Some of these men look so bizarre that it’s hard to imagine them conforming to an interesting character sought by a particular group of women. Can freakishness itself be a strong pivot in attracting women?</p>
<p>但是，“A”型外貌真的意味着“任何”外貌吗？这些男性中的一些人看起来如此怪异，以至于很难想象他们能符合某个特定女性群体所寻求的有趣角色。难道怪异本身就能成为吸引女性的强大因素吗？</p>
<p>“Freakishness” to some is mundane to others. Everyone is playing a role by order of degrees on any given day and in any given circumstance. Where I work I’m free to wear jeans and a t-shirt if I so desire, but I opt to dress much sharper than that, why? Because it commands a certain respect, even if it’s not necessarily legitimate. When I’m at a club, say, doing a new product launch, my persona and dress changes to match the environment.</p>
<p>“怪异”对某些人而言是寻常，对他人则不然。每个人在任何特定日子和情境下，都按程度扮演着角色。在我工作的地方，我可以随意穿着牛仔裤和 T 恤，但我选择打扮得更精致，为何？因为它能赢得某种尊重，即便未必是正当的。比如在俱乐部进行新产品发布时，我的形象和着装会随之调整以适应环境。</p>
<p>A guy like Mystery doesn’t go around wearing elevator boots and top hats to the 7-11 to buy a big gulp. I doubt he even wears that getup to clubs any longer;  those shots were taken in his experimental phase. He still peacocks for sure, but it takes far less now because guys like him have distilled the principle down to what draws attention in various situations.</p>
<p>像 Mystery 这样的家伙不会穿着增高鞋和礼帽去 7-11 买大杯饮料。我怀疑他现在甚至不再穿那种装扮去夜店了；那些照片是在他的实验阶段拍摄的。他依然会通过装扮吸引眼球，但如今所需的程度已大大降低，因为像他这样的人已经将吸引注意力的原则提炼到了各种情境中。</p>
<p>Club hopping in full Gene Simmons stage attire isn’t impressing anyone, but that’s what a lot of guys without a Look like to poke fun at – the extremes. An extreme douchebag, an extreme Emo, an extreme Orange County Chopper style, etc. make for easy targets, but that’s not the point of having A look.</p>
<p>穿着全套吉恩·西蒙斯舞台装扮在夜店间穿梭并不会给人留下深刻印象，但许多没有独特风格的人却喜欢以此取笑——那些极端。极端的混蛋、极端的 Emo、极端的橙县摩托车手风格等等，都成了容易攻击的目标，但这并不是拥有独特风格的真正意义。</p>
<p>Peacocking 孔雀开屏</p>
<p>Peacocking is not a style, it is a functional PUA skill ( use of props actually). It takes a sense of style to know how to pull it off effectively, but peacocking as a skill is more about use-of-instance than it is about your overall look.</p>
<p>孔雀开屏并非一种风格，而是一项实用的 PUA 技巧（实际上是道具的运用）。要有效地运用这一技巧，需要一定的时尚感，但作为一项技能，孔雀开屏更侧重于场合的运用，而非整体外观。</p>
<p>When PUA studies were in their infancy, the idea of peacocking was pretty much a no-brainer. It’s not too hard a concept to follow since most socially intelligent people will want to set themselves apart from the mating herd. Truth be told, everyone peacocks to some degree. Just selecting a tie or a pair of shoes for an occasion may seem innocuous enough, but subconsciously you make choices and develop preferences for certain items in certain situations because you think they improve your appearance, and thus your odds for drawing attention to yourself.</p>
<p>在 PUA 研究初期，孔雀开屏的概念几乎是不言而喻的。这个概念并不难理解，因为大多数社交智商高的人都会想要在求偶群体中脱颖而出。事实上，每个人在某种程度上都会孔雀开屏。仅仅是为某个场合挑选一条领带或一双鞋子，看似无伤大雅，但潜意识里，你会在特定情境下做出选择，培养对某些物品的偏好，因为你认为它们能提升你的外观，从而增加吸引他人注意的几率。</p>
<p>The intent behind peacocking is more about having a subtle difference, or a conversation piece that draws a woman into your frame. Oddly enough (or not) I’ve found that nice expensive shoes seem to be a natural pull for some girls. This isn’t surprising considering most women’s obsession with shoes. One thing that’s important to remember is women’s sensitivity to covert subcommunication, body language, appearance, non-verbal cues, etc. In the briefest glance they’ll size one another up and come to operative conclusions about a woman’s status in their girl-hierarchy. It follows that they use the same tools with the Men they find attractive.</p>
<p>孔雀开屏的意图更多在于展现一种微妙的差异，或是一个能引发女性兴趣的话题，从而将她引入你的框架。奇怪的是（或并不奇怪），我发现一些女孩似乎对昂贵的好鞋有着天然的吸引力。考虑到大多数女性对鞋子的痴迷，这并不令人意外。需要记住的一点是，女性对隐性子沟通、肢体语言、外表、非言语信号等非常敏感。在短暂的目光交流中，她们就能相互评估，并就一个女性在其女性等级中的地位得出实际结论。因此，她们对吸引自己的男性也会运用同样的评判工具。</p>
<p>Most newly Game-aware men who are comfortable enough to venture using Peacocking don’t realize that a little goes a long way. Your Game isn’t peacocking, it’s just the flashy lure to get the fish to strike. It’s up to you to play the fish once it’s hooked.</p>
<p>大多数刚了解游戏并敢于尝试孔雀开屏策略的人并未意识到，适度即可事半功倍。你的游戏并非孔雀开屏本身，那只是吸引鱼儿上钩的闪亮诱饵。一旦鱼儿上钩，如何操控则全凭你的技巧。</p>
<p>I should add here that it sometimes helps if you can combine an element of  Chick Crack to your flair item. Of all the strippers I’ve ‘dated’ every one subscribed to some form of non-mainstream spiritualism. This girl Angie I used to bang kept Tarot cards in her pink lady’s devotional Bible, another professed to be a psychic, etc. These types look for that connection in a guy. For instance I bought a very smal silver yin-yang ring that I’ve worn for almost 18 years now when I was in college. I don’t really have any eastern mystic beliefs, I just bought it from a street vendor at the time when I felt I needed a reminder to keep balance in my life. But damned if I haven’t had more women point it out and ask me about it, and have it be some karmic conversation starter since I got it. The thing is tiny, but that’s a cue that they gravitate towards.</p>
<p>我应该在这里补充一点，如果你能在你的魅力物品中融入一丝“小妞迷药”的元素，有时会大有裨益。在我“交往”过的所有脱衣舞女中，每一位都信奉某种非主流的灵性主义。比如，我曾交往的安吉，她将塔罗牌放在她那本粉红色的女士祈祷圣经里；另一位则自称是灵媒，等等。这类女性在寻找与男性的那种精神上的联系。举个例子，我在大学时买了一枚非常小的银质阴阳戒指，至今已佩戴了近 18 年。我并没有什么东方神秘信仰，当时只是觉得需要在生活中保持平衡，便从街边小贩那里买下了它。但自从戴上它后，确实有更多女性注意到并询问我关于它的故事，它成了开启心灵对话的契机。这戒指虽小，却是她们所倾向的信号。</p>

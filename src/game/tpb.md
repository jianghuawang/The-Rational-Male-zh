# The Pheromonal Beta 信息素贝塔

*You choke the chicken before any big date, don’t you?*

你在大约会前会先解决一下个人问题，对吧？

*Anyone who’s seen Something About Mary is pretty familiar with the now classic ‘Hair Gel’ incident.*

看过《情迷玛丽》的人对如今经典的“发胶”事件应该相当熟悉。

*Dom: You choke the chicken before any big date, don’t you? Tell me you spank the monkey before any big date. Oh my God, he doesn’t flog the dolphin before a big date. Are you crazy? That’s like going out there with a loaded gun! Of course that’s why you’re nervous. Oh my dear friend, please sit, please. Look, um, after you’ve had sex with a girl, and you’re lying in bed with her, are you nervous? No, you’re not, why?*

多姆：你在任何重要约会前都会“掐鸡”，对吧？告诉我，你在任何重要约会前都会“拍猴”。哦，天哪，他不会在重要约会前“鞭打海豚”。你疯了吗？那就像带着一把上了膛的枪出去！当然，这就是你紧张的原因。哦，我亲爱的朋友，请坐，请坐。听着，嗯，在你和女孩发生关系后，你和她躺在床上，你会紧张吗？不，你不会，为什么？

*Ted: Cause I’m tired… 泰德：因为我累了……*

*Dom: Wrong! It’s ’cause you ain’t got the baby batter on the brain anymore! Jesus, that stuff will fuck you’re head up! Look, the most honest moment in a man’s life are the few minutes after he’s blown his load – now that is a medical fact. And the reason for it is that you’re no longer trying to get laid, you’re actually… you’re thinking like a girl, and girls love that.*

多姆：错了！那是因为你脑子里不再想着那些婴儿浆糊了！天哪，那玩意儿会把你脑子搞乱的！听着，一个男人一生中最诚实的时刻就是他射完后的那几分钟——这可是医学事实。原因在于，你不再试图上床，你实际上……你在像女孩一样思考，而女孩们喜欢这样。

Even if you’ve never seen the film, it’s likely you’re at least peripherally aware of the Beta Game principle Dom is explaining here. Can you spot the inconsistency?

即使你从未看过这部电影，你可能至少对多姆在这里解释的 Beta 游戏原则有所耳闻。你能发现其中的不一致之处吗？

“.. you’re thinking like a girl, and girls love that.” No, they don’t. Sorry Dom, they want a loaded gun.

“……你像女孩一样思考，女孩们喜欢那样。”不，她们不喜欢。抱歉，多姆，她们想要的是一把装满子弹的枪。

Desexualization as Game is one of the primary mistakes betas make. This is the ‘Something About Mary’ effect; the presumption that your biological impulse to desire sex is a hinderance to getting sex. From a rational standpoint this is ridiculous, but betas eat this idea up because it dovetails nicely into their misguided sexual conditioning that assumes like attracts like – identify more with the feminine to be more attractive to the feminine. Watching this movie is like an effort in deconstructing all the Beta Game tenets of the past 40 years.

去性化作为游戏是贝塔们常犯的主要错误之一。这就是“关于玛丽”效应；假设你对性的生物冲动是获得性的障碍。从理性的角度来看，这是荒谬的，但贝塔们却对此深信不疑，因为它与他们错误的性教育观念相吻合，即认为相似吸引相似——更多地认同女性特质以更吸引女性。观看这部电影就像是在努力解构过去 40 年来的贝塔游戏原则。

I apologize for not having the sources to site for this, but I can remember reading case studies on the bio-chemical effect of human sexual interaction doing grad work in college. I believe they were done by Dr. Martie Hasselton, but they outlined the endorphin and hormonal profiles present in healthy adults bloodstream’s while in various phases of attraction, arousal, pre-sex and post-sex interaction between couples. The most dramatic one to look up is the similarities in the chemical properties of dopamine and heroin for people experiencing “love” or “infatuation” depending on who’s doing the study.

我为无法提供相关资料来源而道歉，但我记得在大学攻读研究生期间读过关于人类性互动生物化学效应的案例研究。我相信这些研究是由 Martie Hasselton 博士完成的，它们详细描述了健康成年人在不同吸引、兴奋、前戏和后戏阶段，血液中内啡肽和激素的分布情况。最引人注目的是，研究显示，当人们经历“爱情”或“迷恋”时，多巴胺与海洛因在化学性质上的相似性，具体取决于研究者的角度。

Even more fascinating is the effects hormones play on portions of men’s brains when assessing sexual cues in a potential sex partner. Healthy testosterone levels literally causes men to perceive women as sexual objects; stimulating the same portions of our brains used for cognitive problem solving. However, testosterone is mitigated by oxytocin, the hormone secreted just post orgasm. While testosterone is responsible for sex drive and aggressive impulses (not to mention muscular development, deepening of voice and hair growth), oxytocin is linked to feelings of nurturing, trust, and comfort. Oxytocin is believed to be a primary influence in post-sex, and post pregnancy, emotional attachment in women who produce the hormone in much higher amounts than men. Postpartum depression is actually a withdrawal symptom triggered by the decrease in oxytocin (and progesterone) in post-birth women.The effect of post-orgasm oxytocin in men is similar to women, however in men it is also serves as a buffering agent to heightened dopamine and testosterone levels.

更引人入胜的是激素在男性大脑评估潜在性伴侣的性暗示时所起的作用。健康的睾酮水平实际上会让男性将女性视为性对象；刺激我们大脑中用于认知问题解决的相同区域。然而，睾酮受到催产素的调节，催产素是在高潮后分泌的激素。虽然睾酮负责性欲和攻击性冲动（更不用说肌肉发育、声音加深和毛发生长），但催产素与养育、信任和舒适感有关。催产素被认为是女性在性行为后和产后情感依恋的主要影响因素，因为女性产生的催产素量远高于男性。产后抑郁症实际上是由于产后女性体内催产素（和孕酮）水平下降而引发的戒断症状。男性高潮后催产素的影响与女性相似，但在男性中，它还充当高多巴胺和睾酮水平的缓冲剂。

Oxytocin plays a critical part in regulating a man’s testosterone levels. Just post-orgasm, the human body flushes oxytocin into the bloodstream to balance out the endorphin and dopamine high of sexual arousal. While this hormone promotes feelings of trust and comfort in men, it also serves to ‘calm the guy down’ sexually. Oxytocin is a testosterone buffer in men, thus resulting in you going limp for a while after busting a nut. From an evolutionary perspective this makes sense in that it ensures the sperm deposited stays in a woman’s vagina, thus increasing fertility odds, instead of being shoveled out by a still erect penis. Not only that, but oxytocin serves as a ‘pair bonding’ hormone in that it fosters feelings of protective trust in men. Oxytocin discharge in humans is also triggered by pheromonal and environmental prompts.

催产素在调节男性睾酮水平中起着关键作用。性高潮后，人体会迅速将催产素注入血液，以平衡性兴奋带来的内啡肽和多巴胺高峰。尽管这种激素能促进男性产生信任感和舒适感，但它也在性方面起到“让男人冷静下来”的作用。催产素是男性的睾酮缓冲剂，因此射精后你会暂时疲软。从进化角度看，这合乎情理，因为它确保了精子留在女性阴道内，从而提高受孕几率，而不是被仍然勃起的阴茎排出。不仅如此，催产素还作为“配对结合”激素，激发男性产生保护性的信任感。人类催产素的释放还受到信息素和环境因素的触发。

In addition to all of this, there’s the role that pheromones play in regard to sexual attraction and arousal. You can google these, but there are several pheromonal studies that indicate that men with differing scents from those of women tend to attract opposite scents in women. From an evolutionary perspective the conclusion drawn is one that people of similar genus or genotype (i.e. blood related family members) will be less aroused sexually by persons of the their own genotype, thus ensuring biodiversity (nature’s prevention plan against inbreeding). However in the same “sweaty t-shirt” studies, the perspiration of men with higher testosterone levels were deemed more sexually viable or arousing by women than men with lower T levels.

除了上述所有因素，信息素在性吸引和性唤起中的作用也不容忽视。你可以通过谷歌搜索这些信息，但有几项信息素研究表明，与女性气味不同的男性往往更能吸引女性。从进化的角度来看，得出的结论是，具有相似属或基因型（即血缘相关的家庭成员）的人对与自己基因型相同的人性唤起程度较低，从而确保了生物多样性（自然防止近亲繁殖的策略）。然而，在同样的“汗湿 T 恤”研究中，女性认为睾酮水平较高的男性汗液更具性吸引力或更易唤起，相比之下，睾酮水平较低的男性则不然。

You can attribute whatever legitimacy you want to studies like this, but the evidence points to higher testosterone levels as playing an influential part in sexual attraction. Also bear in mind that pheromones influence women living in close proximity to each other to synchronize their menstrual cycles – another evolutionary mechanism believed to ensure fertility and communal support for social animals.

你可以赋予这类研究你想要的任何合法性，但证据表明，较高的睾酮水平在性吸引力中起着重要作用。还要记住，信息素会影响生活在彼此附近的女性的月经周期同步——这是另一种进化机制，被认为能确保社会动物的生育能力和群体支持。

## The Pheromonal Beta 信息素贝塔

From a bio-mechanical perspective, the indication is that men who consistently masturbate are essentially broadcasting their status as Pheromonal Betas – and women’s bio-chemical mechanics subconsciously registers this for them. Higher testosterone males manifest their sexual viability in both sexual assertiveness and scent. If you are chronically depleted of testosterone, and/or subjected to the calming effects of oxytocin your sexual viability is at a disadvantage. In fact, from an evolutionary standpoint, the beta males of our feral hunter-gatherer beginnings would be more prone to masturbation as a sexual release since, theoretically, they would’ve had less access to breeding opportunities than Alpha males. It would then follow that definitive, subconscious behavioral and chemical cues would evolve to aid females in selecting the best mate for parental investment.

从生物力学的角度来看，有迹象表明，那些持续自慰的男性实际上是在向外界传递他们作为信息素贝塔的信号——而女性的生物化学机制会潜意识地对此进行识别。高睾酮水平的男性通过性主动性和气味来展现他们的性活力。如果你长期睾酮水平低下，或受到催产素的镇静作用，你的性活力就会处于劣势。事实上，从进化的角度来看，我们野性狩猎采集时代的贝塔男性更倾向于通过自慰来释放性欲，因为理论上，他们比阿尔法男性拥有更少的繁殖机会。因此，可以推断，为了帮助女性选择最佳伴侣进行亲代投资，会进化出明确的潜意识行为和化学线索。

So, for as much as beta guys would like to have you believe that snapping your radish before a date will improve your chances of fucking the girl, odds are you’re shooting yourself in the foot. This stupid belief is rooted in the “Something about Mary” myth that women don’t want an overly sexualized man, but the biological truth is far from that. The myth is one that women need to be comfortable with a guy in order to sleep with him, so men will actively desexualize themselves in order to comply. However, all indications point to a need for sexual anxiety and tension in arousal to prompt sexual intercourse.

因此，尽管那些所谓的“贝塔男”可能想让你相信，在约会前折断你的萝卜会增加你与女孩上床的机会，但事实上你很可能是在自找麻烦。这种愚蠢的信念源于“关于玛丽的传说”，即女性不喜欢过于性感的男人，但生物学真相远非如此。这个传说的核心是，女性需要在与一个男人上床前感到舒适，因此男性会主动去性化自己以迎合这一需求。然而，所有迹象都表明，性焦虑和紧张感在激发性行为中是必要的。

Comfort and trust are post-orgasm conditions; anxiety, arousal and sexual urgency are pre-orgasm conditions – and both have their own unique hormonal signatures.

舒适与信任是高潮后的状态；焦虑、兴奋和性急迫则是高潮前的状态——两者各自拥有独特的激素特征。

## Disclaimer 免责声明

And now for the disclaimer; I’m not a endocrinologist, biochemist or physician. I’ll admit this is a work in conjecture, but it’s plausible conjecture. For the record, it’s not about ‘less’ desirable pheromones, it’s about a lower incidence of any sex-cue pheromones due to depletion. It stands to reason that women would be more attracted to men motivated to being sexual with them, manifesting this in chemistry and behavior, than sexually unmotivated men manifesting signs of disinterest.

现在进入免责声明环节；我不是内分泌学家、生物化学家或医生。我承认这是一项基于推测的工作，但这是合理的推测。需要说明的是，这并非关于“不那么”理想的费洛蒙，而是由于消耗导致性暗示费洛蒙的减少。合乎逻辑的是，女性会更倾向于那些对她们有性动机的男性，这种动机通过化学反应和行为表现出来，而不是那些表现出不感兴趣迹象的性动机不足的男性。

I used to think that the primary issue with beating off was this feminine double standard – women masturbating is sexy, arousing and, nowadays, socially empowering. For men, masturbation is a perversion. It implies an inability to be ‘man enough’ to fuck a real woman; whacking off is failure for a man, but victory for a woman. Why would this social conditions exist, and what is it’s latent function?

我曾认为，打飞机的主要问题在于这种女性双重标准——女性自慰是性感、撩人且如今社会赋予力量的行为。而对男性而言，自慰则被视为一种堕落。它暗示着无法“足够男人”去与真实女性发生关系；对男人来说，打飞机是失败，但对女人来说却是胜利。为何这种社会条件会存在，其潜在功能又是什么？

I still see the double standard in all that, and while I think it’s valid, it kind of only brushes the surface of self-pleasure from a social convention perspective. Sigmund Freud once said, “all energy is sexual”, meaning that subliminally we will redirect our motivation for ungratified sexual impulse to other endeavors. Thus it’s men, being the sex with the highest amount of libido inducing testosterone, who must look for far more outlets to transfer this motivation to than women. So is it any real surprise that it’s historically been Men who’ve primarily been the empire builders, the conquerors, the creators, and destroyers who’ve (for better or worse) moved humanity the most significantly?

我依然察觉到其中的双重标准，尽管我认为它有其合理性，但某种程度上它仅触及了从社会习俗角度出发的自我愉悦的表层。西格蒙德·弗洛伊德曾言：“所有能量皆为性”，意指潜意识中，我们会将未满足的性冲动转化为其他追求的动力。因此，拥有最多激发性欲的睾酮的男性，必须寻找比女性更多的途径来转移这种动力。所以，历史上主要是男性成为帝国的缔造者、征服者、创造者与毁灭者，他们（无论好坏）极大地推动了人类的发展，这难道还有什么真正的意外吗？

Masturbation defuses this impulse. It kills that drive, or at least sublimates it. So wouldn’t it stand to reason that a global social convention that shames men for masturbation would be beneficial to a society interested in expanding? So the cultural meme becomes men who jack off are losers, and Men who don’t thereby prove their sexual viability (because if they’re not beating off they MUST be fucking women semi-regularly) AND become motivated to redirect that impulse to the betterment of themselves and/or society.

自慰化解了这种冲动。它扼杀了那种驱动力，或至少将其升华。因此，一个全球性的社会习俗，如果羞辱男性自慰，是否有利于一个渴望扩张的社会呢？于是，文化符号便演变为：自慰的男人是失败者，而那些不自慰的男人则证明了他们的性能力（因为如果他们不自慰，那必定是在定期与女性发生关系），并且他们会被激励将这种冲动转向自我提升或社会进步。

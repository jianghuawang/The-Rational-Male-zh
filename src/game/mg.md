# Meta-Game 元游戏

In the starting of this blog I’ve recently been contemplating the last 6 or so years I’ve spent on SoSuave. Every time I consider the things I’ve written for the ‘community’ I always need to put them into the perspective of where I’ve come from and what I’ve learned in that time. I just reviewed a ‘single-mommy’ story in an other forum thread, one that I learned from almost 20 years ago. I also go into how things were before the advent of the internet occasionally.

在这篇博客的开头，我最近一直在思考过去六年在 SoSuave 度过的时光。每次我回顾为“社区”所写的文章时，总需要将它们置于我成长和学习的背景中。我刚刚在另一个论坛帖子中重温了一个“单亲妈妈”的故事，这个故事是我近 20 年前学到的。我也偶尔会回顾互联网兴起之前的情况。

I think it’s really hard for a generation of young Men to fully appreciate the progress that guys in their mid-30s, mid-40s and even 50s have made in their respective times. It’s hard for mid 20s and teenage guys to relate to a time before the level of communication we take for granted today. There was no term for an AFC, beta or “herb” in 1995. I didn’t own a cell phone until 2002 and never texted anyone regularly until 2005. When guys in their 30s and 40s now were learning the lessons I relate here, there were no forums, no PUAs (formally anyway), and the phenomenon we call feminization and the ‘Matrix’ was at the peak of it’s influence by virtue alone of no one questioning, let alone being aware of, its influence. We lacked the male-to-male social communication, certainly the global communication, to really bring common experiences together and form ideas from those observations. We were in the dark. Remember, no Tom Leykis, no internet, and the “how to pick up girls” books were what losers ordered by mail from an ad they saw in the back of a Hustler magazine. In fact porn was only accessible by renting it from the back room of a VHS rental store, by magazine or pirating the Spice channel from cable. Good times.

我认为，对于年轻一代的男性来说，要完全理解 30 多岁、40 多岁甚至 50 多岁的男性在他们各自时代所取得的进步，确实非常困难。20 多岁和十几岁的年轻人很难与今天我们习以为常的沟通水平之前的时代产生共鸣。1995 年，还没有 AFC、beta 或“草食男”这样的词汇。我直到 2002 年才拥有手机，直到 2005 年才开始定期发短信。当现在 30 多岁和 40 多岁的男性在学习我提到的这些经验时，没有论坛，也没有正式的 PUA（搭讪艺术家），我们称之为“女性化”和“矩阵”的现象，仅凭无人质疑、甚至无人意识到其影响，就达到了影响力的巅峰。我们缺乏男性之间的社会沟通，尤其是全球性的沟通，无法真正将共同经历汇聚起来，并从中形成思想。我们处于黑暗之中。记住，没有汤姆·莱克斯，没有互联网，那些“如何搭讪女孩”的书，是失败者通过邮件从《花花公子》杂志背面广告订购的。 事实上，色情内容只能通过租借 VHS 租赁店后屋的录像带、购买杂志或从有线电视中盗取 Spice 频道来获取。美好的时光。

Now lets flash forward to 2011. I can’t go a day without having viagra or porn solicited to me in my email. Porn is now part of the utilities; it’s like hot and cold running water now, but moreover, so is the collected experience of literally a world of men considering the same nagging questions. Thanks to globalized, instant communications, a new generation of Men can collectively consider experiences and observations that were previously left unsaid. Where before there was a stigma of “not being man enough” just in asking questions and seeking relevant advice about women, now it’s been replaced by the ‘community’.

现在让我们快进到 2011 年。我每天都会收到推销伟哥或色情内容的电子邮件。色情内容如今已成为生活必需品的一部分；它就像现在的冷热水一样普遍，但更重要的是，全球男性共同面对的那些令人烦恼的问题也变得如此。得益于全球化、即时通讯的便利，新一代男性能够集体思考和分享那些过去未曾言说的经历和观察。以前，仅仅因为提问和寻求关于女性的相关建议就被贴上“不够男人”的标签，如今这种耻辱已被“社区”所取代。

**The internet is to Men what the sexual revolution was for women.**

互联网之于男性，犹如性革命之于女性。

The genie is now out of the bottle, and for better or worse the information is liberating. This is the Meta-Game. Lets consider it for a moment: Just last week I added my voice to a chorus of other men from around the world to help out a young man struggling with his AFC problems. I joined guys from Britain, Australia, Spain, Canada, New York, Los Angeles, and anywhere in between. A global collective of Men advised this kid. That’s pretty powerful stuff. This is one world of men advising a young man about his situation with a girl acculturated in a world influenced by women for five decades.

精灵已出瓶，无论好坏，信息已获得解放。这就是元游戏。让我们稍作思考：就在上周，我与其他来自世界各地的男性一同发声，帮助一位正与 AFC 问题斗争的年轻人。我与来自英国、澳大利亚、西班牙、加拿大、纽约、洛杉矶及各地的伙伴们联手。这是一群全球男性的集体智慧，为这个小伙子提供建议。这力量不容小觑。这是一个由男性组成的全球网络，为一位在女性主导影响下成长了五十年的世界中，与女孩相处有困惑的年轻人出谋划策。

This is the Meta-Masculine pushing back against the Meta-Feminized. We’re now aware that this Feminine Matrix is everywhere, and I think we all can appreciate how encompassing and pervasive it is. I know the LoveShack.orgs of the world are largely the antithesis of the Meta-Masculine. I didn’t say the mountain looked easy to climb. However, just the collectivity of the global community gives me hope. Every time we unplug a guy from the Matrix it’s a group effort. We are the collective fathers these sons never had.

这是元男性对元女性化的反击。我们现在意识到这种女性矩阵无处不在，我想我们都能体会到它的广泛性和渗透性。我知道像 LoveShack.org 这样的地方很大程度上是元男性的对立面。我并没有说攀登这座山看起来容易。然而，全球社区的集体性给了我希望。每次我们从矩阵中解救一个人，都是集体的努力。我们是这些儿子从未有过的集体父亲。

Yes, there’s differences of opinion. The community advocates, Game gurus, and theorists of the world are going to lock horns over priorities, but the bigger pictures is making Men aware. The global collective waking them up is the first and best benefit. It is dirty, filthy, work unplugging Men from the Matrix, but that’s the start.

是的，存在意见分歧。社区倡导者、游戏大师和世界理论家们将在优先事项上针锋相对，但更大的图景是让男性觉醒。全球集体唤醒他们是首要且最佳的益处。将男性从矩阵中解放出来是肮脏、污秽的工作，但这是起点。

If I’m optimistic about anything it’s in the hope that the next generation of men will at least have the opportunity to be made aware of the “code” in the Matrix – that simply didn’t exist when I was struggling to unplug myself. By that I mean that a younger generation of men will develop at least a capacity, or at least a sensitivity to acknowledge that certain feminine social conventions exist, and were the gender roles reversed they’d be accused of sexism. I’ve always felt that making these comparisons is the first real step in understanding what the Matrix is. I am far more attentive to the veiled, socially excusable, feminine sexism that we casually pass off in common culture today because I realize the latent function those conventions serve. Like G.I. Joe says, knowing is half the battle.

如果我对某事抱有乐观态度，那便是希望下一代男性至少有机会意识到《黑客帝国》中的“代码”——这在我在努力摆脱束缚时根本不存在。我的意思是，年轻一代的男性将至少培养出一种能力，或至少一种敏感性，以承认某些女性社会习俗的存在，并且如果性别角色互换，他们将被指责为性别歧视。我一直认为，进行这些比较是理解《黑客帝国》真正意义的第一步。我更加关注那些隐晦、社会可接受的、女性性别歧视，因为我们今天在大众文化中随意忽视的这些习俗，我意识到它们潜在的功能。正如 G.I.乔所说，了解是战斗的一半。

The main obstacle for the positive-masculine Meta Game is that a majority of the same men it would serve are the unwitting (or at least willfully ignorant) pawns of the feminized Meta Game. I think its wrong to think of these men – the betas, the AFCs, the naive Alphas – as “recruits” for the feminine imperative. I come to that because it takes an entire feminized society to condition a young man over the course of a lifetime to psychologically ego-invest himself in the feminine Meta Game as a means to achieving his best interests. They need to be raised and trained before the ego-investment becomes self-propagating, at which point only extremely traumatic experiences will open his eyes to that conditioning.

积极阳刚的元游戏面临的主要障碍在于，它所服务的多数男性实际上是不自觉（或至少是故意无知）地成为女性化元游戏的棋子。我认为将这些男性——贝塔男、AFC 男、天真的阿尔法男——视为女性主导力量的“招募对象”是错误的。我之所以得出这个结论，是因为需要一个完全女性化的社会，才能在一生中对一个年轻人进行心理上的自我投资训练，使其以女性化元游戏作为实现自身最佳利益的手段。在他们的心理自我投资变得自我传播之前，需要进行培养和训练，只有极其创伤性的经历才能让他看清这种条件反射。

I used the example of a typical rAFC or ‘seeking’ young man asking for advice from the collective at SoSuave. Almost universally the problems they want to solve are themes so tired and so thoroughly covered by the collective of men in the community that we’ll defer them to well-worn advice or rephrase old posts on the same topic. I do this myself, but think about the profundity of that for a moment. Here we have a questioning guy dealing with a problem I dealt with, sometimes, over 20 years ago, and men my senior dealt with 30 or even 40 years ago. The memes haven’t changed much in the past 60 years. I think a common missive is to think that the only reason guys seek out the community is to “get laid more” or “find the secret to getting their dream girl”. While that’s a definite motivator, so many more want solutions to relational problems that have existed in their current form for over half a century now. How do I get her back? Why did I just get LJBFed? Why does she fuck the Jerk, but tell me I’m a such a great guy? Do looks matter? How do I get my LTR to bang me now that we moved in together? There are countless others. Our Meta Game does a great disservice to ‘seekers’ when we dismiss them as just wanting to get their lay numbers up. Of course that’s only the recognizable motivator, but what they’re really searching for, what they’re unaware they’re searching for, is a real, positive, confidence in a masculinity that can rise above the chatter of the invectives of feminized Meta Game.

我以一个典型的 rAFC 或“探索”型年轻男子向 SoSuave 社区集体寻求建议为例。他们几乎无一例外地希望解决的问题，都是社区中男性集体早已深入探讨过的陈旧主题，因此我们往往会提供耳熟能详的建议，或者重新阐述同一话题的旧帖。我自己也这样做，但请思考一下这背后的深远意义。这里有一个正在面对问题的年轻人，他所遇到的问题，我有时在 20 多年前也经历过，而比我年长的男性则在 30 甚至 40 年前就已面对。过去 60 年来，这些主题几乎没有太大变化。人们常误以为，男性寻求社区帮助的唯一原因是为了“多上床”或“找到赢得梦中女神的秘诀”。虽然这确实是一个强大的动力，但更多的人希望解决那些已经存在了半个多世纪的关系问题。如何挽回她？为什么我刚被 LJBF（Let's Just Be Friends）了？为什么她选择和混蛋上床，却告诉我是个好人？外貌重要吗？我们同居后，如何让长期关系中的她现在就和我上床？这样的问题不胜枚举。 我们的元游戏对“探索者”造成了极大的伤害，当我们仅仅将他们视为想要增加性伴侣数量时。当然，这只是一个显而易见的动机，但他们真正在寻找的，他们未曾意识到自己在寻找的，是一种真实、积极的自信，一种能够超越女性化元游戏中谩骂声的男性气概。

When I see 5 pages of advice explaining to that noob the reasons he’s in the situation he finds himself in, and instructing him how best to deal with it based on collective experiences while opening his perspective up to consider the greater landscape he’s in, that is the masculine Meta Game pushing back. Think of that; a poor, isolated kid, frustrated by how to approach, how to deal with a LJBF, how to man-up, etc. pits the influence of a world-wide collective of men’s experience against the behaviors and mindset of an individual girl who’s been socialized and acculturated by the feminized imperative. That is the Meta Game.

当我看到 5 页的建议，向那个菜鸟解释他陷入当前境地的原因，并根据集体经验指导他如何最好地应对，同时开阔他的视野，让他考虑所处的更大环境时，这就是男性元游戏在发挥作用。想象一下；一个贫穷、孤立的孩子，因如何接近、如何处理 LJBF、如何变得更有男子气概等问题而感到沮丧。他将全球男性集体经验的影响力与一个被女性化社会化和文化熏陶的女孩的行为和心态相对抗。这就是元游戏。
